Metis Settlements Land Registry Modernization Policy Book Proposal (2025–2026)
1. Rationale and Statutory Framework
The Métis Settlements Land Registry (MSLR) modernization is grounded in a clear legal and operational rationale. All Registry functions must comply with the Metis Settlements Act (MSA) and its regulations, as well as the Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC) Land Policy[1]. Modernization ensures these legal requirements are automated and consistently enforced through digital tools. Key statutory and policy underpinnings include:
•	MSA Section 106 – Subdivision Approval: This section mandates that no partial interest in Settlement land can be registered without Settlement Council’s prior subdivision approval. Historically, partial interests were recorded even before formal subdivision, leading to fragmented land holdings. The new system and policies explicitly enforce MSA s.106: MSLR will reject any partial interest registration lacking a Council-approved subdivision plan[2][3]. This protects land integrity and prevents unauthorized fragmentation, aligning with legislative intent.
•	MSLR Regulation – Provisional Métis Title (PMT) Expiry: Sections 30(1)(b), 30(2), and 73(1)(a)(ii) of the MSLR Regulation set strict timelines for PMT expiry and the requirement to notify holders[4]. In the past, inconsistent handling of expired PMTs (e.g. delayed cancellations or late renewals) caused legal uncertainty. The modernization addresses this by automating expiry checks and notifications. For example, the system will automatically issue 60-day notice letters before a PMT expires, and will auto-cancel unrenewed PMTs after the deadline, as required by regulation[5]. This ensures timely compliance with the Regulation and removes discretion that previously led to errors or backlogs. Members’ statutory rights to object (per MSLR Reg s.73) are also preserved via a new online objection process, providing due process in cancellations[6].
•	MSGC Land Policy: The MSGC Land Policy (General Council Land Policy) provides additional rules on land matters – for instance, limits on land holdings per member and procedures for land allocations and estate instructions. The modernized framework integrates these policy requirements into the system’s rules. For example, acreage limits set by MSGC policy are now checked automatically by the registry portal[7], and the system flags any registration that would exceed a member’s allotment cap[8]. Another example is estate transfers: section 7.8 of the MSGC Land Policy guides the handling of estate instructions. The new policy manual requires estate transfers to comply with those rules, and the digital registry keeps estate instructions confidential until needed[9]. By embedding MSGC policy parameters into software, MSLR ensures General Council policies are consistently applied in every transaction.
•	Comparative Framework – Alberta’s ARLO System: The modernization is inspired by and aligned with Service Alberta’s Alberta Registries for Land Online (ARLO) program. ARLO is Alberta’s new digital land titles system that increases efficiency, streamlines processes, reduces wait times, and improves services for land title transactions[10]. MSLR’s proposal leverages ARLO’s concepts to benefit Métis Settlements. For example, secure API connections will link MSLR with the Alberta parcel mapping fabric in ARLO for validating survey plans and legal descriptions[11]. The MSLR portal will mirror ARLO’s user-friendly features like guided forms, status dashboards, and help centers to address user needs[12]. This interoperability means MSLR records and survey coordinates will mesh with provincial land data standards, enhancing accuracy and trust. By adopting proven ARLO digital standards, the MSLR can modernize with lower risk and ensure compatibility with broader land administration systems in Alberta.
•	Legal Supremacy and Privacy: Modernization upholds legal supremacy – the principle that the MSLR’s operations remain fully subject to the MSA, regulations, and applicable laws[1]. The system’s design includes role-based access controls tied to MSA Section 98 (which restricts who may access the Settlement Members List)[13]. The digital platform enforces these access rules by verifying user roles (e.g. council, administrator, member) and logging all access, ensuring only authorized personnel can view sensitive member information[14]. Compliance with privacy legislation is built-in: audit logs and encryption protect personal data, in line with Alberta’s privacy laws and the MSA’s confidentiality requirements. Data sovereignty is also respected – all Settlement data will be stored on secure servers in Alberta, with encrypted backups and disaster-recovery systems in place[15] to prevent data loss or corruption. In summary, the rationale is to modernize the MSLR in a way that automates legal compliance, enhances efficiency, and aligns with both Métis self-governance policies and provincial best practices.
By grounding the initiative in these statutes and policies, the proposal ensures that digital transformation augments compliance and service delivery rather than changing substantive rights. The result will be a registry that operates strictly within its legal mandate (MSA and MSGC policy) while using modern tools to fulfill that mandate more effectively[16][17].
2. Final Consolidated Policy Book (2025 Edition)
As part of modernization, all existing land registry policies are consolidated into a single Modernized MSLR Policy Manual (2025 Edition). This manual integrates statutory requirements, 2009–2014 practice directives, MSGC Land Policy directives, and new digital workflow standards (drawing on the Alberta Land Titles “ARLO” model)[18]. The core numbering and structure of policies from the previous MSLR Policy Guide are retained for continuity (Policies 1 through 16), but each policy is updated with modern language and procedures. The manual is organized with clear sections for Context (background and rationale), Policy Statement (the rule or directive), Implementation (how it will be executed, especially in the digital system), and Impacts (expected outcomes or changes). Foundational principles of the new manual emphasize a “digital‐first” approach while preserving legal integrity and service to members:
•	Legal Supremacy – The registry’s first principle is that all actions comply with the MSA, MSLR Regulation, MSGC Land Policy, Surveys Act, privacy laws, and Settlement bylaws[1]. The manual reflects this by cross-referencing legislative authority for each policy and removing any outdated practices that conflicted with current law.
•	Digital-First, Paper-Permitted – Every transaction should be completed through the MSLR Digital Portal by default, which speeds up processing and creates an electronic audit trail. However, recognizing the digital divide, the manual allows paper submissions when a client lacks reliable internet or when an original signed instrument (like a will for an estate) must be presented[19]. Even in those cases, MSLR staff will input the data into the digital system so that the registry remains centralized and up-to-date. In effect, paper is a fallback rather than the norm.
•	Role-Based Access & Auditability – The system enforces user permissions based on roles defined in the MSA (e.g. only authorized Council or MSLR staff can see the Members List as per s.98 MSA)[13]. Every action in the system – view, submission, approval, or edit – is logged and auditable[17]. The manual includes policies on access control (see Policy 6) and document correction (Policy 14) that emphasize transparency and traceability of all registry changes.
•	Automation of Rules – Key statutory and business rules are now encoded in the digital process. For example, the system automatically checks for acreage caps, expired interests, membership status validity, required Council approvals, and document completeness[20]. This reduces staff discretion in routine compliance matters (e.g. the portal will simply not accept an incomplete request, per Policy 7) and ensures equal treatment. Automation is always within legal limits – if a rule cannot legally be enforced by MSLR (e.g. rejecting a transaction due to member acreage limits without clear authority), the system will flag it for information but not block it[21][22]. Overall, this principle minimizes errors and speeds up processing.
•	Inter-Government Interoperability – The new MSLR system securely interfaces with external databases to streamline verification. Confirming survey coordinates with Alberta’s ARLO parcel map, checking an applicant’s Indian Registry status (to enforce s.90 MSA dual-membership prohibitions), or searching Alberta’s Personal Property Registry for liens can all be done via API connections[11]. This interconnectivity prevents duplicate data entry and ensures that MSLR decisions are made with up-to-date information from other jurisdictions. The manual’s survey and mapping policies (e.g. Policies 8 and 13) explicitly require using standard Alberta Township System coordinates and licensed surveyor data to facilitate this integration[23][24].
•	User-Centered Service – Modernization refocuses MSLR on being a service-oriented registry. The digital portal provides guided forms, status dashboards, and self-service tools for members, Settlement councils, industry (surveyors), and government partners[12]. Users can track the progress of their filings in real time. A Help Center and even a chatbot are envisioned to assist users online[25]. Multi-channel communication (portal notifications, emails, and traditional mail where needed) ensures all clients are kept informed of status changes (for example, receiving a 60-day expiry notice both by mail and digitally). These features address accessibility and aim to make the registry more transparent and client-friendly, consistent with ARLO’s approach.
•	Data Sovereignty & Security – Given the sensitivity and cultural importance of Settlement land records, the data will reside in Alberta and be protected to high standards[15]. All transmissions are encrypted. A secondary government data center will continuously back up the registry (disaster recovery), guarding against system failures or data corruption. Regular security audits (as outlined in Policy 16) will be conducted, and the system employs multi-factor authentication and timeout rules to prevent unauthorized access[26][27]. In practical terms, the manual instructs staff and users on strict password and authentication protocols and defines an incident response plan if any security breach is detected. The emphasis on data sovereignty also reassures that Métis Settlements retain control over their data under Alberta’s jurisdiction.
Below is a summary of each policy in the 2025 Consolidated MSLR Policy Book, highlighting the modernized elements and compliance points. (Each policy retains the original number and title from the prior policy guide for continuity):
1.	Policy 1 – Partial Interests: Recording & Subdivision Approval. Context: Historically, Settlement members sometimes sold or gifted part of a land interest without formal subdivision, which conflicted with orderly land management. Now, MSA section 106 explicitly requires Settlement Council subdivision approval before any partial interest registration[2].
Policy: MSLR will not record any partial interest in Settlement land unless a duly approved subdivision plan from the Settlement Council is provided[28]. Any submission lacking an approved plan (or with only a conditional plan) is rejected as incomplete, with a deficiency notice issued (see Policy 7 for handling incomplete requests)[29]. Pre-policy partial interests (recorded long ago without subdivision) are grandfathered but flagged for review.
Implementation: The digital portal will require an upload of the Council-approved subdivision plan for any partial transfer application[30]. The system integrates with Alberta’s spatial data (ARLO parcel fabric) to validate that the plan matches official survey standards and coordinates[31]. MSLR staff must verify the plan’s approval with the relevant Settlement Council before proceeding. Settlement land clerks are expected to help members obtain and upload these approvals to avoid delays[32].
Impacts: This policy safeguards legal integrity by enforcing MSA s.106 – no premature fragmentation of Settlement land[33]. It protects Settlements from unapproved subdivisions and ensures Council control over land division. The digital check reduces processing delays (no more back-and-forth to get missing plans) but does require training members and councils on the new process (uploading digital plans), addressing the digital literacy gap[33].
2.	Policy 2 – Sending 60-Day Expiry Notice Letters. Context: Under MSLR Regulation s.30 and s.73, Provisional Métis Title (PMT) interests expire after their term unless renewed. The law requires the Registrar to notify the interest holder that their interest appears to have expired and will be cancelled unless the holder objects within 60 days[4]. Previously, MSLR sent these notices by registered mail and would not cancel the interest if the letter was unclaimed, causing many expired interests to remain “in limbo”[34]. This policy modernizes the notice process.
Policy: MSLR will send 60-day expiry notices to PMT (and Allotment) holders at least 60 days before the interest’s expiry date[35]. The notice informs the holder of the expiry date, the steps to renew, required fees, and that failure to respond will result in cancellation[36]. Importantly, registered mail will no longer be the sole method – notices will be sent by regular mail (relying on the legal presumption of delivery) and by digital means for those who opt in[36][37].
Implementation: The system will automatically generate an expiry reminder 90 days prior to each PMT’s expiration[38]. This accounts for mailing time so that by 60 days out, the member has the letter in hand. The portal sends electronic notifications (secure email or account alerts) the moment the letter is generated[36]. Settlement Land clerks will receive copies of all such notices, so they can follow up locally with members (e.g., in case of address changes)[39]. Members are responsible for keeping their mailing address current (MSA s.76(c) obliges this), and failure to receive a notice (e.g., not checking mail) will not stop expiry – the policy clarifies that the countdown is from when the notice is sent, not received[40]. If any notice letter is returned or undeliverable, MSLR will coordinate with Settlement staff to find an updated address[41].
Impacts: This eliminates past uncertainty where unclaimed registered letters stalled cancellations. Regular mail + digital notice ensures due diligence in contacting the member while allowing the Registrar to proceed after 60 days[42][40]. It enhances member awareness through multiple channels and reduces inadvertent loss of land by prompting timely renewals[37]. It also aligns MSLR with ARLO-era practices, where digital communication is standard, while still preserving paper for those without digital access[37]. Overall, automating and simplifying the notice process will result in far fewer expired interests lingering uncancelled, thus “cleaning up” the registry.
3.	Policy 3 – Objections to Cancellations of Interests. Context: Members have a statutory right to object to the cancellation of their land interest (such as a PMT cancellation) within the 60-day period after notice, per the MSLR Regulation[43]. In the past, it was unclear how objections were handled – some were forwarded to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) and others not acted on, due to ambiguity in the Regulation[44][45]. This policy formalizes a fair process.
Policy: Any member may submit a written objection within 30 days of receiving a cancellation notice (the policy uses 30 days from receipt to ensure it’s within the 60-day window, giving MSAT time to review)[6]. The objection must state valid grounds – e.g. administrative error, lack of notice, payment sent but not processed – and provide supporting evidence if possible[6]. Upon a valid objection, MSLR will suspend the cancellation of the interest pending a review. The MSLR Registrar will issue a written decision on the objection, and if the member is dissatisfied, they may appeal to MSAT as provided by the MSA[46].
Implementation: The MSLR Digital Portal includes an online objection form accessible to members[47]. Members can file objections electronically (with uploads for any evidence) or still submit a paper objection letter if needed, which staff will scan into the system. All objections received will be immediately acknowledged and tracked in an audit log[48]. The Registrar (or delegate) will review objections within 15 business days and update the member via the portal (and by mail if the member prefers) on the outcome[46]. If an objection is complex or raises legal questions, the Registrar may refer it directly to MSAT for determination (leveraging MSAT’s quasi-judicial role)[49][50]. MSLR will not finalize any cancellation until the objection is resolved by either Registrar decision or MSAT ruling. Staff are trained to immediately suspend cancellation actions in the system when an objection flag is triggered, preventing inadvertent loss of an interest during the dispute.
Impacts: This policy upholds procedural fairness and member rights in the registry’s processes[51]. It creates a clear channel for members to be heard, addressing past criticisms that objections “fell through the cracks.” The digital tracking of objections increases transparency – every objection and its resolution are logged, which can be audited by MSGC or MSAT if needed[52]. Efficiency is also improved: members can submit objections 24/7 online and get prompt status updates, rather than waiting on mail or coming to the office[53]. While digital submission is encouraged, maintaining a paper option ensures no member is disenfranchised by technology[51]. In sum, the policy balances speed (quick suspension of cancellation) with fairness (giving members their day to appeal), aligning with ARLO’s goal of efficient yet user-centric service[54].
4.	Policy 4 – Renewal and Cancellation of Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and Allotment Interests. Context: Under the MSLR Reg., PMTs have a 5-year term (renewable once). In the past, late renewals were sometimes accepted even after expiry (or even after cancellation), and some expired PMTs were never cancelled at all, leading to confusion in land records[55][56]. This policy enforces a strict approach to renewals and cancellations to comply with the law.
Policy: Renewal Deadlines: Only renewal applications submitted before the PMT’s expiry date will be accepted[57]. Any application received even one day post-expiry is to be rejected, and the PMT interest will be cancelled on its expiry date as scheduled[57]. There is no discretion to accept late renewals – members must meet the deadline.
Renewal Processing: If a renewal application is received on time with all required documents and fees, MSLR will process it immediately (the interest continues without lapse). If the renewal submission is incomplete, it will be returned with a deficiency notice per Policy 7 (no “holding” partial applications)[58].
Cancellation Process: Any PMT or Allotment that is not renewed by expiry will be automatically cancelled on the expiry date (following the 60-day notice if applicable)[59]. The system will issue a cancellation confirmation to the member and update the land registry to show the interest as cancelled. Settlement offices will also be notified for their records[60].
Implementation: The digital portal enforces the deadline by blocking any renewal submission once the expiry date has passed[60]. This technically prevents staff from even accidentally accepting a late application. A countdown timer may be visible on the member’s dashboard for any PMT showing days remaining to renew, increasing awareness[60]. On the expiry date, if no renewal was logged, the system auto-issues a cancellation and generates notices to the member and Settlement Council. MSLR staff are relieved from making case-by-case judgment calls – the rule is coded. However, staff will still review incoming renewals for completeness and fee payment (ensuring Policy 7 compliance on completeness). The portal’s design makes it easy to pay fees online and prompts for any missing info to minimize incomplete filings.
Impacts: This eliminates inconsistent practices of the past and provides clarity: members now know a hard deadline and consequence. It ensures compliance with the regulatory timelines strictly[61]. Automation of cancellation reduces administrative burden and the risk of human error (no more missed cancellations or ad-hoc extensions)[62]. However, the policy does require robust member education – people must adjust to the new “no grace period” reality. MSLR will do outreach so that members understand they can’t rely on late renewals anymore. In aligning with ARLO principles, this automated rule following yields efficiency and legal certainty, while still respecting Métis-specific constraints (e.g. acknowledging that a regulatory amendment would be required to change these deadlines)[63].
5.	Policy 5 – Termination of Membership and Termination of Land Interests. Context: When a Settlement membership is terminated (voluntarily or otherwise), that individual’s land interests are typically supposed to revert to the Settlement or be cancelled (since only members may hold Settlement land). However, in practice, many membership terminations were left incomplete or on hold due to missing documents or awaiting member action. There were also exceptional cases (such as Vicklund v. Peavine Settlement) where equity required special handling of land upon membership loss[64]. This policy streamlines how membership terminations are handled in the registry while respecting exceptions.
Policy: Existing Terminations on Hold: MSLR will conduct a one-time cleanup of old cases – any membership termination files that have been sitting incomplete or conditional will be returned to the sender (e.g. the Settlement or MSGC) with a notice to the affected ex-member (where possible) explaining what is required[65]. MSLR will not keep files in limbo; the onus is on the initiating party to complete the documentation. If and when a resubmission comes back fully complete, it will be processed immediately.
Future Membership Terminations: Going forward, whenever a Settlement Council or the MSGC notifies MSLR of an approved membership termination (e.g., resignation or removal under MSA provisions), MSLR will process it immediately if all required documentation is in order[66]. Required documents might include proof of Council resolution, any appeal results, and any member instructions for land disposition. Upon processing, all land interests of that person are terminated simultaneously (since a non-member cannot hold land), except where explicit exceptions apply. Exceptions could include a court order delaying land cancellation, an equitable arrangement for family members, or a directive arising from cases like Vicklund (which dealt with fairness in unique circumstances)[64][67]. The policy acknowledges such exceptions: if a termination has special conditions, those will be honored (e.g., a grace period for the person to transfer land to an eligible family member).
Implementation: The digital system links membership status with land holdings. When staff update a member’s status to “terminated,” the system will automatically flag all land interests of that person and prepare them for cancellation[67]. However, the system will check for any “exception flag” on that profile – for instance, a flag could be set if MSAT or a Court has ordered a stay on cancelling land for that individual. Interests with no exception will be cancelled in the registry (with notifications to the Settlement council and any interest holders like mortgagees). Staff must verify all incoming termination notices for completeness (similar to Policy 7 incomplete submissions) to ensure legal requirements (per MSA s.90+ on membership) are met. The portal also notifies Settlement councils when a member’s land interests have been terminated, so they can take any local action needed (e.g., reallocate the lands). All actions are logged.
Impacts: This policy will clear backlogs of unresolved membership/land terminations, improving the accuracy of the registry (no more showing interests under people who are no longer members)[68]. It brings discipline to the process: either the paperwork is complete and the termination is done, or it’s sent back rather than half-done files lingering. The integration of membership and land records in the system is a major improvement – previously these were tracked somewhat separately. Automation here aligns with ARLO’s efficiency goals, yet the design still allows human oversight for unique Métis circumstances (the Registrar can intervene if an exceptional case arises)[68]. Members and councils will be better informed through notifications, and overall trust in the registry will increase knowing that membership changes are promptly and properly reflected in land records.
6.	Policy 6 – Accessing the Settlement Members List. Context: The Settlement Members List (the official list of all members for each Settlement) is confidential. Section 98 of the MSA restricts who may access this list: essentially, it’s limited to authorized persons because it contains personal information of members. In the past, physical access to the list was controlled, but a digital system requires built-in access permissions.
Policy: Access to the Members List is limited strictly to: (a) Settlement Council members and their authorized staff; (b) MSGC members and authorized staff; (c) designated government officials who require it for regulatory or oversight purposes; (d) legal representatives who have the member’s consent; and (e) of course, individual members may access their own information on the list[13]. Any request to access the list must state the purpose and scope of information needed, ensuring it aligns with the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act and MSA rules[69]. Unqualified persons (e.g., a random community member curious about others) will be denied access to protect privacy.
Implementation: The MSLR Digital Portal uses role-based accounts. Users will only see the data their role permits. For instance, a Settlement Administrator logging in will have a dashboard link to “Members List – [Their Settlement]” but not to other Settlements. If a government Indigenous Relations officer logs in, they might have access to view membership statistics but not personal details unless authorized. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for anyone with access to sensitive personal data, adding a security layer[26]. Every access or search on the Members List is recorded in an audit log (who accessed, what was viewed)[14]. For any manual or in-person requests (say a councilor comes in asking MSLR to look something up), staff must verify that person’s identity and authorization (e.g., confirming they are indeed a council member or have a release form from the member)[14]. Only then can they retrieve the info. The system can generate a certified extract of the Members List for authorized purposes (like a court order) with the Registrar’s approval.
Impacts: Member privacy is strongly protected while still allowing those who need the information to get it[70]. The risk of unauthorized data viewing (a concern in earlier years) is mitigated by technical controls and legal accountability (audit trails). This is in line with broader modernization goals in Alberta to secure personal data in digital systems[70]. Members can trust that their personal details aren’t freely accessible, building confidence in the digital registry. From an operational standpoint, automating access control also frees staff from having to constantly guard paper files; the system itself enforces the privacy rules.
7.	Policy 7 – Incomplete Requests to MSLR. Context: One persistent source of inefficiency was incomplete submissions – for land transactions or membership changes – that lacked necessary information (missing signatures, legal land descriptions, council approvals, etc.). In the past, MSLR often held such files in pending status and engaged in prolonged correspondence to get them completed, which led to confusion, delays, and even unfairness (some people’s files languished while others got processed)[71]. A 2009 practice directive already stated MSLR should not accept incomplete requests; this policy reinforces and modernizes that approach.
Policy: MSLR will not accept nor process any transaction request (land or membership) that is not complete upon submission[72]. “Complete” means all required forms filled, required signatures and approvals obtained, and fees included. If a submission is incomplete, MSLR will immediately reject and return it with a written Deficiency Notice itemizing what is missing[72]. There will be no indefinite “hold” of uncompleted files. Every applicant is to be treated the same – no favoritism by giving extra time; consistency is key[73].
Implementation: The digital portal itself will enforce completeness. It has required fields and an intake checklist for each type of application. For example, if someone tries to submit a land transfer without attaching proof of Settlement Council approval (where required), the system will flag it and not allow final submission[74]. Instant feedback will tell the applicant what is missing (much like online tax filing software flags missing fields)[74]. If somehow an incomplete request does get to staff (e.g., a paper submission by mail that’s missing info), staff will generate a Deficiency Notice letter using a system template and send it to the applicant and the relevant Settlement office within a few days[75]. The notice will clearly list the deficiencies and state that the request was not processed. The policy, originally effective October 1, 2009, continues now with these digital enhancements effective 2025, meaning no grandfathering of old incomplete files – they all must comply now[76].
Impacts: This policy streamlines operations and ensures fairness[77]. Staff no longer spend time chasing documents; the responsibility is on the applicant to submit properly. It reduces backlog because files aren’t sitting idle – they are either in or out. Members and Settlement staff will quickly learn to complete applications upfront, especially with the portal guiding them. The result is faster turnaround for those who do submit properly. The multi-channel deficiency notice (both paper mail and portal notification) means the applicant is promptly informed and can take action[77]. Aligning with ARLO-like user-centric design, this approach treats all users equally and avoids disadvantaging anyone – in fact, the real-time validation in the portal helps people get it right the first time, which is a very user-friendly feature[74][78]. Over time, we expect significantly fewer deficient submissions thanks to these proactive checks.
8.	Policy 8 – Digital Maps and Plans. Context: Modern land registries rely on GIS and digital plans for accuracy. Historically, MSLR stored survey plans in paper or basic electronic formats (AutoCAD files) that weren’t integrated with any GIS; this made it hard to verify locations or produce up-to-date maps[79]. Also, without integration to Alberta’s land titles mapping, Settlement surveys risked misalignment with provincial coordinates. This policy embraces digital survey plan submission and integration.
Policy: MSLR will now accept digital survey plans (e.g. CAD files or other approved formats) that are signed and sealed by an Alberta Land Surveyor, as required by the Surveys Act[80]. Plans must use the Alberta Township System (ATS) coordinates and include all necessary details (easements, rights-of-way, encumbrances, etc.). Essentially, any plan submitted should meet the same technical standards as Alberta Land Titles requires. While digital submission is strongly preferred for efficiency, the policy allows paper plans transitionally – recognizing some surveyors or settlements might need time to switch – but ultimately the goal is full digital plan use[81]. All new subdivisions or surveys within Settlements must also have Settlement Council approval recorded, per MSA requirements, before being registered (this carries forward existing practice).
Implementation: The Digital Portal provides a module for uploading survey plan files. It performs validations: for example, it can check that the surveyor’s license number is valid by cross-referencing a database of Alberta Land Surveyors[82]. It will also validate that the plan file has geo-references that match the ATS (for instance, the plan should include coordinates that align with known township grid points). If a plan fails these checks, the system will alert the submitter to correct it. Once a plan is accepted, it gets stored in a GIS-linked database, and key parcel data (boundaries, area, etc.) populate the registry’s map. MSLR will maintain backup paper copies of plans during the transition period as a fail-safe[82], but over time the authoritative record will be the digital file. Settlement Councils, via their portal access, will receive an electronic copy of any plan affecting their lands and will be required to digitally sign-off (approve) within the system before the plan is considered fully registered[83].
Impacts: Embracing digital plans will greatly enhance accuracy and efficiency[84]. Staff can instantly pull up a parcel’s map and see its boundaries, rather than sifting through files. It reduces manual data entry of metes and bounds descriptions, thus reducing errors. Integration with ARLO’s parcel fabric means that if a Settlement boundary or parcel ties into crown land or neighboring titles, everything aligns – a big step forward in mapping consistency[85]. Storage needs are reduced (less physical storage of large plan rolls) and plans are easier to search. However, this does require training for surveyors (some of whom may not have submitted digitally before) and for Settlement staff to review digital maps. The policy’s transitional period for paper is designed to ease this shift[86][87]. In the long run, digital mapping supports better land management and has been a success factor in ARLO’s rollout, which we expect to mirror here.
9.	Policy 9 – Estate Instructions. Context: Settlement members can leave estate instructions (essentially wills for their Settlement land interests) that dictate how their land should transfer upon death. Managing these is sensitive – it must follow legal requirements (MSA and MSGC Policy) and remain confidential until needed. Inconsistencies in handling estates historically led to disputes. This policy updates the handling of estate instructions.
Policy: Key rules are: (a) An estate instruction must dispose of the member’s entire interest to a single heir or entity – no partial fragmentation of one interest is allowed via a will (to prevent slicing up land interests)[88]. (b) If a member did a land transaction before death that wasn’t yet registered (e.g. promised to transfer land but hadn’t filed it), that pending deal does not override a properly filed estate instruction – the registry will follow the latest valid instruction on file at death[89]. (c) If multiple estate instructions were filed over time, the most recent one (that is validly executed) prevails, automatically revoking older ones[90]. (d) Estate instructions on file are kept confidential; MSLR will only disclose them to authorized parties (like the executor or a court) after the member’s death[91]. Until then, even staff access is restricted to need-to-know.
Implementation: MSLR will maintain a secure digital vault within the portal for estate instructions[92]. Members (or their lawyers) can upload estate instruction documents, which will be encrypted and not generally viewable by MSLR staff except the Registrar or a delegate upon the member’s death. When a death is reported (with a death certificate), the system will mark the member as deceased and reveal the estate instruction to the Registrar for execution. Automated conflict checks will run: the system will compare the estate instructions to current registered interests and flag any discrepancy (for example, if the instruction says “leave Section X to my son” but Section X was transferred before death, it flags that as a conflict)[93]. This helps the Registrar and possibly MSAT/courts to sort out any challenges. Upon confirmation, the system will then process the transfer as per the instruction (transferring title to the named beneficiary, provided they are eligible to hold Settlement land – if not, further steps with the Settlement Council may be needed). Settlement Council is notified when an estate instruction is activated/executed, since they often need to approve transfers to non-members or supervise land divisions[94].
Impacts: This policy ensures orderly succession of land interests and minimizes disputes among heirs[95]. By having a clear, confidential repository, members are encouraged to file their instructions knowing they will be honored. The digital storage with limited access addresses privacy concerns that were raised in the past about who could see someone’s will[91]. Automated checks further reduce the chance of mistakes or overlooked facts (like a double transfer). These changes align with the broader modernization: ARLO’s efficiency is mirrored by automating estate transfers, but we’ve tailored it to Métis needs by preserving confidentiality and Council oversight where required[96]. In practice, this means faster and fairer settlement of estates – an important aspect of member service.
10.	Policy 10 – Limits on Member Land Holdings. Context: The MSGC Land Policy imposes acreage limits on how much land a single member can hold, aiming to ensure equitable distribution. However, the MSLR historically had limited ability to enforce these caps, especially for certain types of interests (e.g., the law did not clearly empower the Registrar to refuse a registration that put someone over the limit). This policy clarifies MSLR’s stance within current legal confines.
Policy: MSLR will enforce acreage limits for new Métis Title registrations in accordance with MSGC Land Policy caps[97]. Practically, if a transfer or new grant of Métis Title would put the member over the allowed acreage, MSLR will not register it (the member or Settlement would need to seek an exemption or not proceed). For PMT and Allotment interests, where current law is less clear, MSLR will not outright reject a registration that exceeds the limit (since the Regulation doesn’t explicitly give that power), but will flag it as an issue and notify the member and Settlement Council[21][98]. In short, no one can acquire new permanent title beyond the limit, and temporary holdings beyond the limit will be formally noted for follow-up by governance (but not refused by the Registrar absent a regulatory amendment).
Implementation: The portal includes an “acreage calculator” linked to each member’s profile[99]. When any new interest registration is submitted, the system calculates the member’s total acreage of Settlement land if that registration went through. If it exceeds the policy threshold, the system: (a) for a Métis Title transfer, will prevent submission and inform the user that it exceeds limits; (b) for a PMT/Allotment, will allow submission but will clearly flag to MSLR staff and on the member’s record that the limit is exceeded[99]. In the latter case, MSLR’s procedure is to include a note in the registration confirmation to the member and Council saying “This member now exceeds the recommended land holding limit of X acres as per MSGC policy.” Additionally, the system will produce regular reports (e.g., quarterly) to MSGC and Settlement councils listing any members who exceed the limits[8]. This brings transparency and enables policy leaders to consider action (such as possible bylaw amendments or just monitoring).
Impacts: This policy promotes equity in land holdings by ensuring the formal rules are applied where possible[22]. Even where MSLR lacks full authority, flagging the issue means it doesn’t slip through unnoticed. It respects the separation of powers: MSLR doesn’t overstep its legal mandate (e.g., it won’t unlawfully refuse a registration it legally must accept)[21], but it also doesn’t ignore General Council policy – it highlights non-compliance so that the political/governance side can address it. Over time, if legislation is amended to empower enforcement of these limits, the system can easily start rejecting transactions beyond the cap. For now, alignment with ARLO’s automation is seen in how the system calculates and warns automatically, yet Métis-specific nuances are respected by not taking unauthorized action[22].
11.	Policy 11 – Interests on Unsurveyed Land. Context: Significant portions of Settlement areas may not be formally surveyed into parcels, which complicates registering interests (land descriptions may be imprecise or temporary). Historically, unsurveyed lands were handled with rudimentary descriptions or not registered at all until surveyed, which caused uncertainty for members occupying those lands. This policy creates a way to register interests on unsurveyed land using modern tools, while ensuring eventual formal survey.
Policy: MSLR will allow provisional registration of interests on unsurveyed land using one or more of the following descriptive methods[100]: (a) Alberta Township System (ATS) descriptions (quarter-sections, etc.) if applicable; (b) GPS coordinates with a specified accuracy (e.g., within a few meters, using standard datum); (c) natural or artificial boundary references (e.g., “200m north of the intersection of X creek and Y road” for remote areas); and/or (d) a qualified sketch plan drawn by a surveyor or technician. Such registrations will be flagged as “unsurveyed – subject to survey.” They must be formally surveyed before any subdivision or long-term transfer occurs[101]. Essentially, it’s a temporary accommodation.
Implementation: The digital registry includes a Spatial Records Module. When an interest on unsurveyed land is submitted, the system will prompt for coordinates or ATS location info. It will store this data in a GIS layer marked as unsurveyed[102]. The system can map these points/shapes so that if multiple unsurveyed interests are recorded, they can be visualized relative to each other (reducing overlap/conflict). MSLR will work with Alberta’s mapping agencies to tie these to the provincial map as “interim” parcels. Importantly, the system will periodically generate a list of unsurveyed registered interests and provide it to Settlement Councils so they can prioritize surveys for those areas[103]. A condition can also be placed: before any subdivision of an unsurveyed interest or conversion to a permanent Métis Title, a proper survey must be done (the system would require a plan upload per Policy 13). Members holding unsurveyed land will be notified that they must update their land description once a formal survey is completed for that area[104].
Impacts: This approach enables members to have recognized interests even on unsurveyed land, protecting their rights and allowing them to, for example, use the land interest as collateral or pass it in an estate[105]. It improves accuracy by using GIS and coordinates instead of vague descriptions, which is a big step forward. It also gives Settlements a clear roadmap of where surveys are needed most, supporting better land-use planning. For MSLR staff, having these in the system reduces the risk of “missing” an informal holding – everything is recorded. The downside could be that handling coordinate data is new for staff, so training is needed to interpret GPS info. However, aligning with ARLO’s advancements, incorporating spatial tech addresses long-standing issues in land administration[105]. Over time, this should lead to fully surveyed Settlements without denying registrations in the interim.
12.	Policy 12 – Allocation Interests. Context: “Allocations” are temporary or conditional land rights often given to members while they await a full Métis Title or long-term interest. In the past, some allocations lingered for years without being converted to permanent title or renewed, contrary to policy intent, effectively letting members hold land indefinitely on an “interim” basis. This policy sets clear rules for allocations to ensure they are transitional.
Policy: All allocation interests will be registered with a specified term/expiry date (e.g., a 1-year or 2-year term as per the Council’s allocation decision)[106]. Before that term expires, the allocation should either be converted to a permanent form (like the member obtains a PMT or Métis Title for the land) or renewed for another term with Settlement Council approval[107]. If an allocation reaches its expiry date with no renewal or conversion, MSLR will cancel it just as we do for PMTs[108]. Transferability of allocations is restricted – generally, a member cannot sell or transfer an allocation to someone else unless allowed by MSGC policy (which typically they are not, or only with Council permission)[109]. The policy thus prevents allocations from becoming de facto permanent via repeated transfers.
Implementation: The system will treat allocations similarly to PMTs in terms of tracking terms. When an allocation is registered, staff will input its expiry date. The portal will send reminders to the holder (and Settlement Council) as the expiry approaches, much like the PMT 60-day notices[110]. There will also be a “conversion workflow” in the portal: for example, if a member with an allocation applies for a PMT on that same land, the system can link the records and on issuance of PMT automatically cancel the allocation. Guided steps for members might be provided (e.g., “Do you have an allocation to convert? Click here to apply for title.”). Settlement Councils will get notifications of upcoming allocation expiries and any renewal requests, so they can make timely decisions[110]. If an allocation expires unrenewed, the system cancels it and notifies the member and Council (mirroring the PMT cancellation process). All these actions are logged.
Impacts: The benefit is preventing indefinite occupation on temporary rights – ensuring that either members move to secure tenure or the land goes back into circulation for others[111]. It promotes fairness (no one can squat on an allocation forever) and encourages formalization of land rights, which is good for members (permanent title is more valuable). Digitally tracking these means fewer will “fall through the cracks” as happened before. This policy’s automation (reminders, expiries) mirrors ARLO user tools for things like lease renewals in the broader system[111]. It combines automation with community governance, since renewals still need Council approval – the system just makes sure Council is prompted to act rather than forgetting an allocation for 10 years[112]. We expect an overall tightening of land records and elimination of a backlog of stale allocations.
13.	Policy 13 – Survey Plan Requirements. Context: This policy complements Policy 8, focusing on the quality and approval of survey plans. Even in a digital regime, surveys must meet legal standards and involve Settlement oversight for land within settlement boundaries.
Policy: All survey plans submitted to MSLR must be prepared and signed by a licensed Alberta Land Surveyor, per the Surveys Act (which ensures professional accountability)[113]. Plans must include necessary details such as accurate ATS coordinates, and show any easements, rights-of-way, or encumbrances affecting the land[24] (so that the title derived from the plan will correctly list those). Digital format (CAD or similar) is preferred for these plans, as noted, and those digital plans will be validated through the ARLO-linked tools[114]. Crucially, any new survey defining parcels in a Settlement requires Settlement Council approval before MSLR will register it[115]. This reiterates the principle of local land governance – councils control subdivision and boundary changes in their communities.
Implementation: The portal’s survey upload feature (from Policy 8) will specifically check for the surveyor’s license validity (via an integration to the Alberta Land Surveyors Association database)[116], and that the plan format matches standards. Upon submission of a survey plan, the system will route a copy to the relevant Settlement Council (or land authority) through their dashboard for review. MSLR will not finalize the registration (i.e. assign plan number and incorporate into parcel map) until a Council representative digitally signs off approval in the system[116]. If a paper plan is submitted (during transition), staff must scan and forward it to Council and obtain written approval, which is then attached to the record. After Council approval, the Registrar signs the plan (digitally or physically) to officially file it. Paper submission remains allowed mainly for transition or in case of technical issues, but the expectation is most survey work will move online.
Impacts: Ensuring survey integrity and Council approval guarantees legal and spatial accuracy in the registry[85]. Members and external stakeholders (banks, etc.) can have confidence that any plan on file meets professional standards and has community consent. The digital integration with ARLO means these Settlement plans won’t be isolated – provincial systems will recognize them, aiding in things like emergency services or regional planning[85]. There is also a cultural importance: Council oversight ensures that even as we digitize, local Métis leadership remains at the heart of land decisions[117]. This policy basically merges modern surveying with traditional authority.
14.	Policy 14 – Document Alterations and Corrections. Context: Occasionally, errors are discovered in registered documents – typos in names, incorrect legal descriptions, etc. In a registry, changes must be controlled; otherwise records could be tampered with. Previously, there was uncertainty about how to correct errors – some were simply pencilled in, others required statutory declarations or court orders. This policy sets a clear protocol.
Policy: Minor clerical errors (e.g., spelling mistakes, obvious numbering errors) may be corrected by MSLR staff, but only with proper documentation and justification and under Registrar’s oversight[118]. Any substantive change (anything affecting rights or boundaries) cannot just be “corrected” – it requires either a new application by the interested parties or a formal MSAT or court order directing the change[119]. All corrections, however minor, will be recorded in the registry with the date, nature of correction, and who authorized it[120]. The original erroneous entry or document will not be erased; it will be retained in the archive for audit trail[120]. If a correction affects Settlement interests (say a correction that changes a land description), Settlement Council must approve it as well before it’s finalized[121].
Implementation: The digital system will have a “correction” workflow for staff. If a member or staff identifies an error, a correction request is initiated. For minor issues, staff fills out an e-form stating the correction reason (e.g., “misspelled surname corrected to…”), which is then approved by the Registrar electronically[119]. The system then updates the record but also logs the old value and new value, timestamp, and attaches the approval note. For substantive issues, staff will inform the requester that a new instrument or MSAT decision is needed. If a court or MSAT order comes in, staff use a special function to implement that order, again with audit logging. Digital signatures (or e-signatures) are used for all correction approvals, leveraging ARLO standards for authenticity[122]. All users with interest in the record (the member, Settlement, etc.) may get a notification if a correction is made so nothing is done silently.
Impacts: This ensures the registry’s integrity and trustworthiness[123]. No changes happen in secret; everything is documented. It prevents potential abuse (someone altering a record without trace). At the same time, it gives a straightforward path to fix honest mistakes, improving data quality. Requiring higher authority for substantive changes protects member rights – e.g., a boundary isn’t going to shift unless duly authorized. This policy is consistent with best practices in land titles systems and addresses a risk noted in earlier risk assessments about data corruption. The digital audit trails and requirement of approvals mirror ARLO’s approach to changes, thereby enhancing transparency and confidence in the modernized MSLR[123].
15.	Policy 15 – MSLR Counter Service. Context: In the early years of MSLR, staff often helped Settlement members by filling out forms, giving advice, or otherwise assisting with land and membership applications. This hands-on approach was well-intentioned but blurred lines – MSLR’s mandate is to register and record, not to provide consulting or legal advice (which is the role of Settlement offices or legal counsel)[124][125]. It also created dependency and possible liability. This policy refocuses MSLR’s in-person (or “counter”) services in the modern era.
Policy: Effective immediately (as it actually was in 2009 and reaffirmed now), MSLR staff will not complete documents on behalf of clients and will not provide advice on how to structure transactions[126][127]. If an individual comes to the MSLR office, staff can answer general questions and direct them to the appropriate Settlement office for detailed assistance[128]. MSLR will continue to perform commissioner for oaths services – i.e., staff can witness the signing of documents in their capacity as Commissioners if a member brings a completed form and ID[129]. They will not act as regular witnesses or as agents. For simple updates that don’t need Council approval (address changes, name changes, etc.), MSLR can process those changes if the member provides the proper ID and documentation[130]. Essentially, anything straightforward and administrative, MSLR can do; anything policy-driven or requiring discretion belongs with the Settlement Council or member to handle.
Implementation: Front-counter training is provided so staff know where to draw the line. For example, a checklist might be at the counter: “We can do X (verify your form is filled, accept payment, administer an oath); We cannot do Y (tell you how to fill the form, determine eligibility, advise on land deals).” The digital portal now includes a comprehensive self-service Help Center with guides and even tutorial videos[131]. When someone asks a common question, staff can show them the relevant guide on the kiosk or computer rather than walking them through it personally. The policy encourages staff to politely refer clients to Settlement Land Clerks for any help in obtaining or completing forms[132]. Settlement offices have the local knowledge and authority to assist their members, and this delineation ensures members get advice from the right place. To facilitate this, MSLR has provided each Settlement with up-to-date templates and checklists so that clerks are well-equipped. In effect, MSLR’s front office becomes more of a facilitator – providing information sheets, maintaining a public computer for portal access, and verifying ID when needed – but not doing the substantive work for the client.
Impacts: This policy clarifies MSLR’s role as a neutral registry rather than an advisory service[133]. It reduces the risk of staff giving incorrect advice or being seen as taking sides in any transaction. It also encourages capacity-building at the Settlement level (members and clerks will handle applications more independently). With the digital portal, many members will self-serve from home or at their Settlement office, meaning fewer will even come to MSLR in person. Those who do will find resources to guide them rather than someone doing it for them. This actually aligns with ARLO’s user-centric model, where the emphasis is on enabling users via an online help center and not having government clerks manually intervene in every step[132]. For staff, while it may initially feel like less “helping,” it allows them to focus on their core processing tasks, improving overall efficiency[134].
16.	Policy 16 – Digital Portal Access and Security. Context: Launching the MSLR Digital Portal opens the registry to 24/7 online access, which is convenient but introduces security risks (unauthorized access, hacking, etc.). This policy sets the standards for system access and security protocols, much of it drawn from ARLO’s security model.
Policy: All users of the MSLR portal must register and have their identity verified (e.g., through government-issued ID and validation of Settlement membership or role)[26]. Users are granted role-based permissions per Policy 6 and other relevant policies (e.g., a Settlement Administrator’s account is marked as such). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for logging in, greatly reducing the chance of unauthorized logins[26]. Portal sessions will automatically timeout after a period of inactivity (for instance, 15 minutes) to prevent someone inadvertently staying logged in on a public computer[135]. All user activities (searches, submissions, downloads) are monitored and logged for security audits[26]. If any unauthorized access attempt is detected (e.g., repeated failed logins, or someone trying to access data they shouldn’t), the system will trigger an alert to MSLR IT administrators and may temporarily lock the account[136]. Regular password updates and strong password requirements are enforced.
Implementation: During portal onboarding, each user goes through an identity proofing step. For members, this might involve confirming personal details against the Members List and a one-time code sent by mail or text. For staff or council users, MSLR will coordinate to set up their accounts with appropriate rights. The system is built within Government of Alberta security infrastructure, with encryption in transit and at rest for all data[15]. Security audits will be scheduled (e.g., quarterly penetration testing, annual third-party review) to probe for vulnerabilities[27]. The policy also includes user education: a security tutorial is provided to all users (covering phishing awareness, safe password handling, etc.)[27]. In case of any incident (like suspected data breach), there’s a response plan: immediate containment (shut down certain functions), investigation, notification to affected parties, etc., consistent with Alberta’s digital security protocols.
Impacts: This policy is crucial for maintaining trust in the digital system[137]. Members will only use the online registry if they believe their information and land interests are safe. By implementing strong authentication and monitoring, MSLR mitigates risks of data leaks or tampering. It also protects the integrity of the records – knowing who did what and preventing unauthorized changes. The requirement of training and user-friendly security (like help articles on avoiding scams) addresses the “human factor” in security[137]. The result is a portal that provides convenient access without sacrificing security, echoing ARLO’s approach where increased access came hand-in-hand with modern cybersecurity measures. In broader terms, this supports the goal of data sovereignty and protection of Métis Settlement information as a treasured asset.
Formatting & Language: The entire consolidated Policy Book is written in plain language, avoiding overly technical or legalistic jargon so that Settlement members, administrators, and staff can easily understand it. Each policy section clearly states requirements and uses consistent formatting for ease of reference. The numbering (1–16) corresponds directly to prior policy guide numbers (as seen in the 2005–2010 policy issues) for traceability, but the text is updated to 2025 standards. The document will be published as an official MSGC Policy Manual, following MSGC’s standard template (logo, headers/footers, etc.) but with a modern layout: hyperlinked table of contents, clear headings, and perhaps infographic sidebars for key tips (e.g., “Digital Tip: You can check your expiry date online”). By consolidating into one manual, users no longer have to cross-reference multiple directives or memos – all active policies are in this single source, which will be accessible both in print (for those who need) and on the portal.
3. Two-Year Budget Proposal (2025–2027) with Cost Savings
Implementing the MSLR modernization will require upfront investment, but it is designed to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by the end of the two-year period. Below is a budget breakdown for two fiscal years (2025–26 and 2026–27), covering key cost categories and anticipated savings. All figures are in Canadian dollars (CAD):
Budget Category	Year 1 (2025–26)	Year 2 (2026–27)
Staffing (FTE Salaries & Benefits) – 5 FTE (Registrar, Deputy, 3 clerks); plus temporary IT support contract	$500,000	$480,000
System Development & IT – Portal development, database integration, ARLO API links, hardware	$250,000	$50,000
Training & Change Management – Staff training, member/council workshops, materials	$30,000	$10,000
Operational Efficiency Gains – Savings from reduced paper, mail, travel, and process improvements	$0	–$100,000 (cost reduction)
Total Expenditure	$780,000	$540,000
Net Budget (after savings)	$780,000	$440,000
Year 1 (2025–26): We anticipate an investment of ~$780,000. The largest portion is staffing ($500k), which includes salaries for existing MSLR staff and a one-time contract IT specialist to help develop and deploy the new system. We do not plan to significantly increase permanent headcount; rather, existing staff will be trained and reallocated as needed (see Staffing Plan below). The development budget ($250k) covers engaging a software vendor or internal government IT team to build the digital portal and ensure interoperability (for example, building the API connections to ARLO and other databases). Training and change management ($30k) covers comprehensive training sessions: we will conduct on-site workshops at all 8 Settlements, develop user guides, and possibly compensate “Digital Champions” in each Settlement to assist members with the portal.
Year 2 (2026–27): The expenditure drops to ~$540,000 before savings (or $440k net). The system development cost in Year 2 is much lower ($50k) as it mainly entails maintenance, minor upgrades, and technical support contracts. Training costs also drop ($10k) as most training will be completed in Year 1, with Year 2 focusing on refresher courses or new staff onboarding. Staffing costs slightly decrease to $480k – this reflects anticipated efficiency gains: for instance, if a staff member retires or is redeployed, we project we can absorb their duties via automation instead of hiring a replacement. Alternatively, reduced overtime or temp staffing (which were previously needed to tackle backlogs) yields savings in personnel costs by Year 2.
Operational Efficiency Gains: By Year 2, we project $100,000 in annual cost savings directly attributable to modernization. These are broken down roughly as:
•	Reduction in Paper & Postage: With digital notices and online submissions, printing and mailing costs will plummet. Currently, MSLR spends significant time and money sending registered mail (e.g., 60-day letters by registered post). Switching to standard mail and email is projected to save at least $5,000–$10,000 in postage and supplies annually[138] (the policy change to regular mail for notices is backed by legislation and saves expense of registered mail fees). Also, the need to print and store paper records is reduced due to digitization, saving on paper, ink, and storage space (some records storage might even be offsite rental space that can be downsized). According to Alberta’s land titles modernization, digital submissions save significant time and expense of handling paper originals[138], which for MSLR could translate to a few thousand dollars and many staff hours saved.
•	Improved Staff Productivity: Automating routine checks and data entry means staff can process more transactions in less time. We estimate at least a 20% productivity gain. In practical terms, this allowed us to eliminate the need for some contract support that was previously required in peak times (valued at ~$40k) and will reduce overtime hours (saving ~$10k). Also, by clearing backlogs (Policy 5, etc.), we avoid the hidden costs of managing old files. The Government of Alberta emphasizes reducing unnecessary oversight and improving service outcomes to drive efficiency[139], and our automation of compliance tasks exemplifies this philosophy (e.g., no longer manually verifying every subdivision or calculating expiry dates – the system does it).
•	Fewer Errors and Rework: With built-in validation, we expect far fewer rejected or returned submissions after Year 1. This indirectly saves money – each resubmission or correction takes staff time (and frustrates members). Quantifying this, if we currently handle ~100 incomplete submissions a year and each consumes 2 hours of staff time in communication and re-processing, automating validation could save ~200 staff hours, roughly $8,000 in wage terms. It also mitigates potential legal costs: an error in land records could lead to disputes or litigation. By minimizing errors, we reduce the risk of costly legal appeals or settlements. This is an intangible but important saving.
•	Consolidation of Legacy Systems: We will retire the old MSLR database and certain manual ledgers by Year 2, reducing IT overhead (maintenance fees, server costs) by an estimated $10,000 annually. All data will be on the new portal infrastructure which is more cost-effective and possibly supported by central government IT at a lower marginal cost.
•	Service Alberta (ARLO) Synergies: By aligning with ARLO, MSLR might benefit from provincial investments in technology. For instance, if ARLO has a mapping tool or security module, using it saves us building our own from scratch. While we budgeted for integration, over time Alberta may allow us to piggyback on updates they develop, saving future development expenses. Also, training materials from ARLO (adapted) reduce our content creation costs.
In Year 2, we count the $100k savings as a negative line item (cost reduction) to highlight the net budget impact. Net operational cost in Year 2 ($440k) is substantially lower than Year 1, demonstrating a return on investment. By the end of 2026–27, the system will largely pay for itself through efficiency gains and cost avoidance. Further, beyond 2027, we expect continued annual savings of ~$100k or more, meaning the initial $300k investment in technology/training is recouped in about 3 years. These savings can be redirected to other critical areas of Indigenous Relations or Settlement services, aligning with the government’s fiscal responsibility goals.
Importantly, this budget aligns with the Indigenous Relations (IR) Business Plan 2025–28 focus on modernization and efficiency. The IR Business Plan emphasizes reducing red tape and improving access to services[139]. Our investment in digital systems is precisely to improve access (members can use services online 24/7) and reduce unnecessary administrative overhead, which supports the IR outcome of efficient program delivery. Moreover, by containing costs and eventually lowering operational expenses, we contribute to the government’s commitment to responsible fiscal management and innovation in service delivery[139]. We will also pursue any available funding from initiatives under the Metis Settlements Economic Sustainability programs (as referenced in Outcome 4 of the IR Business Plan) to help cover these modernization costs[140]. For example, the Metis Settlements General Council’s Accord Implementation fund might support one-time system development, since this project advances long-term sustainability of Settlement governance.
Budget Justifications:
•	The staffing budget assumes current salaries continue with normal increments. We do not foresee layoffs; instead, efficiency gains allow us to handle increased volumes or retire contracts. Any reduction (from $500k to $480k) is expected through attrition or reduced overtime, not abrupt cuts, thereby maintaining service quality.
•	The system development cost of $300k (over two years) is based on rough orders of magnitude from similar projects. For context, ARLO’s development is multi-million (covering the whole province’s system). MSLR’s needs are narrower; we will leverage existing technologies. For example, using open-source GIS or adapting modules from Alberta’s system can cut costs. We will still invest in customizing the interface for our users and migrating legacy data safely.
•	Training costs cover not just staff but also community outreach. We will create plain-language guides (possibly in print and video) and hold info sessions on each Settlement. The cost is justified by the need to ensure adoption – a great system is only effective if people use it correctly. By Year 2, most training materials will be developed, so only minimal ongoing costs remain (like updating guides or training new employees).
•	The operational savings figure of $100k is a conservative estimate considering all the efficiencies described. It does not even monetize some benefits (like faster service to members leading to economic opportunities). However, we prefer to under-promise and over-deliver on savings. The goal is that MSLR’s modernization eventually becomes budget-neutral or better, freeing resources. This aligns with Service Alberta’s findings that digital land systems can handle huge volumes with faster turnaround and fewer staff per transaction[10].
In summary, the two-year budget requires an initial funding allocation of $780k in Year 1, dropping to $440k net in Year 2. By the end of 2026–27, MSLR will operate at a lower annual cost than today, while delivering improved service. This proposal will be submitted as part of the IR Department’s budget estimates, showing a clear business case: one-time investment leads to ongoing savings and fulfills the government’s mandate for modern, outcome-focused program delivery[139]. Any unutilized portion of the budget (if costs come under estimate or if additional savings are realized early) will be returned or reallocated to further improvements such as expanding internet access at Settlements (to mitigate the digital divide).

4. Implementation Plan (Two-Year Rollout)
A phased implementation plan will ensure the MSLR modernization is rolled out smoothly over two years, minimizing disruption and building stakeholder confidence. The plan is divided into Year 1: System Deployment & Adoption and Year 2: Evaluation & Refinement, each with specific milestones:
Year 1 (2025–26) – System Deployment, Training, and Adoption Support
Q1 (Jul – Sep 2025): Planning and Development Kickoff
- Project Team & Governance: Form the MSLR Modernization Task Force, including MSLR Registrar as project sponsor, IT lead (from Service Alberta or contracted vendor), a representative from MSGC, and one Settlement Administrator representative. Establish governance (bi-weekly project meetings, progress reporting to MSGC and IR).
- Requirements Finalization: Using the newly consolidated Policy Book as a blueprint, finalize system requirements. This involves mapping each new policy to a system function (e.g., Policy 2 -> automated notifications, Policy 6 -> access roles). Engage a software developer or Alberta Digital Innovation office to architect the portal.
- Stakeholder Consultation: In early planning, consult Settlement Councils and Land Clerks to gather input on portal features (user interface, language considerations, etc.). Involve at least one focus group of frequent MSLR users (members, maybe legal professionals) to ensure the portal design is user-friendly.
- Technical Development Start: Begin development of the MSLR Digital Portal. Aim to reuse or adapt components from ARLO where possible – for example, the parcel mapping interface and digital signature module. Alberta’s Land Titles modernization team can be a resource here; coordinate to possibly use the same vendor or platform for consistency. Ensure data migration scripts are being developed to transfer existing records into the new system database.
Q2 (Oct – Dec 2025): System Build and Initial Testing
- Core Functionality Build: Complete coding of key modules: user management & login security, transaction intake forms (for transfers, PMT issuance, etc.), automated checks (business rules engine), notification service (email/letter generation), and the GIS parcel map integration. Also set up the audit logging and reporting functions.
- Data Migration (Phase 1): Perform a trial migration of a subset of data (perhaps one Settlement’s records or one type of transaction) into the new system to test compatibility. Clean data where needed (standardize names, etc.).
- Testing – Internal: Conduct internal testing with MSLR staff (“alpha testing”). Staff members test scenarios: register a land transfer, process a PMT renewal, run a cancellation, etc., using dummy data. Bugs and UI improvements are logged. Security testing begins (make sure permissions correctly restrict data).
- Policy Alignment Check: As the system takes shape, cross-verify that each policy’s requirements are met. For example, ensure the 60-day notice letter template in the system matches the policy language, and that the portal prevents incomplete submissions per Policy 7. Any gaps are noted for development.
- Infrastructure Setup: Work with GOA IT to deploy the system on servers (or cloud, as per standards). Ensure the disaster recovery setup is configured (redundant backup at second data center)[141]. This quarter likely sees a lot of IT work behind the scenes.
Q3 (Jan – Mar 2026): Pilot Launch and Training
- Pilot Launch: Roll out the system in a controlled pilot environment by January 2026. One approach is a “parallel run”: choose 1 or 2 Settlements (perhaps one north, one south) to start using the system for new transactions, while still maintaining the old process as backup. Alternatively, pilot by transaction type (e.g., all PMT renewals now through new system, others later). We will likely pilot by region to capture a variety of cases.
- User Training – Staff: Prior to pilot, train all MSLR staff on the new system (likely Dec 2025). They should practice on test cases. Also train Settlement Land Clerks and administrators in pilot Settlements on how to use their council dashboards and upload approvals. Provide quick-reference guides.
- Member Outreach: Announce the launch of the “MSLR Digital Portal” to members of pilot Settlements. Hold community sessions where members can come and get assistance signing up for accounts. We will have on-site support (perhaps bringing a portable training lab) to help members and councilors register and navigate the portal. Emphasize benefits (faster service, transparency) to encourage adoption.
- Support Channels: Establish a helpdesk (could be a dedicated phone line or email) specifically for portal support during the pilot. MSLR staff or the IT contractor will handle queries like “I can’t log in” or “How do I find X.” The help center content goes live with FAQs and step-by-step articles (some borrowed and tailored from ARLO’s help center)[142].
- Monitor and Adjust: Through Q3, closely monitor pilot transactions. For example, if a member tries to submit an allocation renewal and struggles, note what went wrong – is the form unclear or is more training needed? Collect feedback from Settlement councils on their experience (can they approve digitally easily?). Any critical issues will be addressed via patches or process adjustments promptly. The aim is by end of Q3 to fix major bugs and finalize the system for full rollout.
Q4 (Apr – Jun 2026): Full Rollout and Transition Completion
- Full System Go-Live: Target April 1, 2026 (the start of FY 2026–27) as the official go-live for all Settlements. This means from that date, all new transactions should be processed through the digital system. We will communicate a cut-off for old paper processes. However, a grace period is wise – e.g., accept old forms by mail for a few months but encourage immediate conversion to portal.
- Wider Training: Conduct webinars or visits to the remaining Settlements that were not in pilot, to train their staff and inform members. Provide the same support materials. By now we also expect some “super-users” from pilot Settlements (staff or even community members) who can share success stories to convince others.
- Data Migration (Phase 2): Complete migration of all historical active records into the new system by end of Q4. This ensures that even older interests and past transactions are accessible in the portal (likely in read-only form for history). Some archival data (like very old cancelled interests) might remain in legacy archives but everything current should be online.
- Parallel Operations Wind-Down: For April-June, MSLR may run parallel systems as a safety net – meaning staff still maintain updates in the old system as backup while the new one runs, in case any major issue arises. If all goes well, by June 2026 we will cease updating the old database and officially consider the new MSLR Digital Registry as the system of record.
- Celebrate & Communicate: Toward the end of Year 1, showcase the results so far. Possibly host an event or press release highlighting that Métis Settlements have modernized their land registry, paralleling Alberta’s own modernization efforts. This builds confidence and acknowledges the work of staff. Importantly, communicate to all stakeholders (members, councils, lenders, etc.) that the digital system is now the primary way to do business, but reassure that support is available for anyone needing help.
Throughout Year 1, risk management is key. We will have contingency plans: for example, if the digital system fails at any point, staff are prepared to revert to paper temporarily (ensuring continuity of service). Frequent backups and a rollback plan (keeping the old system on standby) are in place until we’re confident in stability.
Year 2 (2026–27) – Evaluation, Policy Calibration, and Legislative Harmonization
Q5 (Jul – Sep 2026): Stabilization and User Feedback
- System Stabilization: After full rollout, monitor the system in various usage scenarios (peak volumes, etc.) over several months. Address any technical performance issues (e.g., if the portal is slow at certain times, scale the server or optimize queries). By Q5, most major kinks should be ironed out.
- User Feedback Roundtable: Convene meetings with each Settlement Council (or a joint session via MSGC’s Land Committee if one exists) to gather their feedback on the system and policy impacts. Are members facing any unexpected difficulties? Are there policy rules that need tweaking (for instance, did Policy 10 flag so many transactions as over acreage that it needs re-evaluation)? Also seek feedback from regular external users like surveyors or financial institutions that interact with MSLR.
- Public Satisfaction Survey: Using the portal, we can pop up a survey for members after they complete a transaction, asking about their experience. Also, track metrics: e.g., average turnaround time for a transfer now versus before (we expect a drop). These data will feed into evaluation.
- Quick Wins: Implement minor improvements identified in feedback. For example, if users request a certain new feature (say a notification to a lawyer when a transaction is done), and it’s feasible, we can add it. Policy-wise, if any clarifications can be issued administratively (like updating a help note or guidance), do so. Essentially, fine-tune the machine.
Q6 (Oct – Dec 2026): Formal Evaluation and Audit
- Midpoint Evaluation Report: Prepare a 1-year post-implementation report for MSGC and the Ministry of Indigenous Relations. This would detail: the objectives achieved, usage statistics, any issues, and whether costs/savings are tracking as expected. This ties into the IR Business Plan metrics on improved services. For transparency, share key findings with Settlement members (maybe via a newsletter or at the MSGC annual assembly).
- Audit (Process and Compliance): Conduct an internal audit to ensure the new processes comply with all statutory requirements. This could involve the department’s internal audit unit or an external auditor (maybe Alberta’s Auditor General if they choose, since land registry is critical). The audit will check things like: are we properly securing data, are transactions being processed with appropriate approvals, and are financial controls (fee collection, etc.) sound in the new system. Also, audit user access logs to verify no unauthorized access occurred (Policy 16 in action).
- Legislative Review: By Q6, identify any needed legislative or regulatory changes that surfaced. For example, perhaps to fully empower Policy 10 enforcement, we might propose an amendment to the MSLR Regulation to explicitly allow the Registrar to refuse registrations over acreage limits. Or maybe an amendment to recognize digital documents officially (if not already in law – though Alberta’s Red Tape Reduction Act 2023 already enabled digital signatures for land titles[143], which might cover us if applied to MSLR). Work with Alberta Indigenous Relations and Justice on drafting any minor amendments to the MSA or MSLR Reg. The goal is to harmonize the legislation with the new digital reality by the end of Year 2. If changes are minor and can be done by Order in Council or MSGC Policy, aim to have those ready to go by Q8.
Q7 (Jan – Mar 2027): Policy Calibration and Integration
- Policy Review Workshop: Reconvene the working group that drafted the 2025 Policy Book to review how each policy is performing in practice. Calibrate any policy that needs adjustment. For instance, if we found that 30 days for objections (Policy 3) is too short in practice, consider recommending extending to 60 (just an example). Or if Settlement Councils find the Policy 1 process of requiring approved plan upfront is causing delays, discuss whether any flexibility is needed. The idea is to refine policies now that we have data from the digital system on volumes and outcomes.
- Issue Amendments or Guidelines: If any changes to the Policy Book are agreed (and within MSGC’s authority), issue an updated edition or an amendment sheet. These would be minor tweaks; the core policies likely remain sound. We might also create additional user guidelines or “Standard Operating Procedures” for MSLR staff, separate from the public policy book, to cover any operational nuances discovered.
- Integration with Other Systems: Use Year 2 to deepen integration with external systems. For example, if Indigenous Services Canada is willing, set up a direct feed to update membership status changes from their Indian Register (ensuring we catch any Section 90 issues quickly). Or integrate with Alberta Personal Property Registry so staff can easily check for liens. These might not have been fully implemented in Year 1 if they were lower priority. By Q7, tackle these to maximize interoperability benefits described in Foundational Principles[11].
Q8 (Apr – Jun 2027): Final Harmonization and Project Closure
- Legislative Harmonization: By Spring 2027, aim to have any required legislative changes enacted. If an amendment to the MSLR Regulation is needed, work with MSGC and Alberta to get it passed by Order in Council around this time. For example, an amendment might officially recognize digital copies as “originals” for filing, or adjust wording to align with new processes (like removing any reference to “mail by registered letter” if we’ve moved away from that, although we’ve done so under existing flexibility). Ensuring the law and practice fully match is important for long-term certainty.
- Documentation & Handover: Wrap up the project formally. Ensure all documentation is finalized: system manuals, admin manuals for staff, the final Policy Book (perhaps labeled “2025–2027 edition” after any Year 2 tweaks). Hand over ongoing system maintenance to the regular operations/IT support (the project team might dissolve, and a permanent process takes over).
- Benefits Realization Report: Prepare a final report highlighting achievements: e.g., “Turnaround time for interest registrations reduced from 10 days to 2 days on average; 95% of transactions now submitted online; backlog of pending files reduced by 100%; $X saved in operating costs” etc. This report can be used by MSGC and the Ministry to demonstrate success and perhaps to secure continued support for further improvements. It also addresses accountability – showing the community what has been accomplished with the resources used.
- Celebration and Acknowledgment: End of Q8, consider a symbolic event, maybe at the MSGC Annual General Assembly 2027, announcing that the MSLR modernization project is complete and the registry is fully modern. This is both to honor the hard work of staff and to signal to all members that their Land Registry is future-ready and reliable.
Post-Implementation (Beyond 2027): Although outside the two-year scope, we will have set up mechanisms for continuous improvement. The digital system will allow easier updates, and we expect periodic reviews (perhaps every 3-5 years) of the Policy Manual to adapt to any new technologies or policy changes. The MSLR staff will continue to work closely with ARLO’s team to stay aligned with provincial advancements, ensuring that Métis Settlements are never left behind in land administration innovation. By the end of Year 2, MSLR should be well-integrated as a modern registry service, serving the community efficiently and accurately, with a roadmap for sustainability.
5. Staffing Guide and Role Rationale
Successful digital transformation requires aligning the roles and skills of staff with the new system. The MSLR currently operates with a small team: a Registrar (statutory head), a Deputy Registrar (or senior officer), and a few registry clerks/technicians. In addition, Settlement Administration staff (land clerks) interface with MSLR on the frontlines. This section proposes how to match these human resources to the modernized registry’s needs, identifies gaps, and outlines training and any new roles.
Current Roles and Shifting Responsibilities:
•	MSLR Registrar: The Registrar remains the key authority for approving registrations, signing off policy, and making judgment calls on complex issues. Under modernization, the Registrar’s role shifts away from routine paperwork (since many decisions are automated) and more toward oversight, exception handling, and system management. For instance, the Registrar will monitor automated cancellations or rejections to ensure they are correct and handle appeals/objections (Policy 3) personally[46]. The Registrar should also take on a leadership role in data governance – ensuring data integrity in the system, authorizing corrections (Policy 14)[119], and liaising with MSAT or the courts on any disputes. With less time spent signing every certificate by hand (as digital certificates can be auto-issued), the Registrar can focus on audits and improvements.
•	Deputy Registrar / Senior Registry Officer: This person traditionally handles day-to-day management of staff and might have signed documents under delegation. In the new model, the Deputy’s role can evolve into a “Digital Registrar Liaison”. They would be the primary liaison with the IT team and ARLO contacts, ensuring the system is configured correctly and any technical issues are translated between end-users and developers. The Deputy can also oversee the new helpdesk function, seeing patterns in user queries and addressing any training needs. Additionally, they’ll still act as Registrar when the Registrar is away, and likely will handle specialized tasks like approving minor corrections (per Policy 14) or vetting complex submissions.
•	Registry Clerks (Registry Technicians): These staff currently do a lot of data entry (typing up registration data, issuing paper certificates) and manual checks. With automation, their tasks will shift to validating system flags, facilitating user support, and maintaining records. For example, if the system flags a subdivision plan as mismatched, a clerk would follow up with the surveyor. Clerks will also take on more of a customer service role via the portal: responding to online inquiries, helping members who walk in to set up accounts, and coordinating with Settlement clerks for any paperwork. We anticipate that one clerk could become a specialist in GIS and plans, managing the digital maps and working with surveyors to upload plans (a new skill area). Another might specialize in membership and estates, focusing on those processes in the system.
•	Settlement Land Clerks: While not MSLR employees, their role is crucial and influenced by Policy 15’s changes. They will become the go-to resource for members locally to help with application forms and now portal use. We plan to train Settlement clerks to be able to navigate the portal from the “client side” so they can walk an Elder through a digital form if needed at the Settlement office. Their role in verifying council approvals and forwarding documents remains, but now via the system (they will upload council meeting minutes or approval documents directly for MSLR to see). We expect Settlement clerks to coordinate with MSLR more fluidly – possibly each clerk has a counterpart registry clerk they communicate with. Role rationale: Keeping advisory functions with Settlement clerks preserves the principle of local governance and culturally appropriate support, as MSLR focuses on technical processing[134]. We will formalize this relationship by perhaps drafting an MOU or guidelines on how Settlement staff and MSLR interact in the digital context (for example, Settlement clerk must check that a member’s application is complete before endorsing it to MSLR).
New Roles / Skill Areas Identified:
•	Digital Systems Administrator (IT Support Liaison): We recommend creating (or designating from existing staff) a role to handle the technical side of the system. This “MSLR IT Coordinator” would manage user accounts (reset passwords, etc.), coordinate software updates with the vendor or Service Alberta, and ensure data backups. This might be a part-time role combined with someone’s existing duties (likely the Deputy Registrar or a clerk with IT aptitude). Given the small size of MSLR, a full FTE just for IT support may not be justified beyond the initial rollout; instead, we might rely on IR’s IT department for heavy support and have an internal point person. If current staff lack the required IT skills, we might arrange a secondment or part-time assignment of an IT specialist from the Ministry to MSLR for the first year, and simultaneously train an existing staff member to take over. This addresses the “gap” of technical expertise.
•	Data Analyst / Reporting Officer: With the wealth of digital data (dashboards, logs), we see value in analyzing it for trends (e.g., how many transactions per month, how many deficiencies, etc.). Currently, MSLR likely doesn’t have a dedicated analyst. We propose that one of the clerks be upskilled to produce regular reports and metrics. This can be done with some training in using the system’s reporting functions. This role helps demonstrate outcomes and could feed into MSGC’s decision-making. Not a new hire, but a new responsibility area.
•	Member Support (Helpdesk) Role: During and after rollout, having a friendly “helpdesk” is critical. We anticipate perhaps 1 staff (or shared among 2) to be responsible for answering the general MSLR phone line and helpdesk email for portal issues. This could rotate among clerks to avoid burnout, but one might take lead. The skill needed is customer service and patience with potentially frustrated users. We will provide customer service training if needed. The key rationale is to maintain user confidence—if they hit a snag and call, someone knowledgeable picks up and guides them. This function was less critical in the purely paper era (where help was in person), but now it is vital.
•	Training Coordinator (Internal): For the continuous training of staff and Settlement clerks, one staff member should champion this. Possibly the Deputy or one of the clerks can be given the responsibility to update training materials and conduct refresher sessions. Given frequent turnover in some Settlement admin positions, this coordinator will ensure new clerks get oriented on MSLR processes quickly, and similarly if new MSLR staff join. The cost is minimal (just part of their job) but planning this role prevents knowledge gaps.
Realignment and Gaps:
•	Reducing Manual Data Entry: Because the system will capture data directly from user submissions, the clerks will no longer spend days typing forms into the database. This frees up at least one FTE worth of effort, which we are reallocating to quality control and support tasks. Realignment example: A clerk who used to do filing and data entry might now oversee the daily dashboard of pending transactions, ensuring none get stuck, and proactively contacting Settlement offices if, say, an approval is pending on their side. This is a more proactive, analytical role than before. We will retrain clerks in using the dashboard and interpreting system alerts, rather than, say, alphabetizing paper files.
•	Training Needs: All existing staff will undergo comprehensive training in: the new portal software, basic IT troubleshooting, data privacy (since now a lot of data is accessible in new ways), and customer service for digital users. Not all staff are currently tech-savvy; part of our budget covers training to bring everyone up to a baseline comfort with computers and the internet. We might pair less tech-confident staff with more confident ones for mentorship. Additionally, staff need training on new regulations/policies – e.g., understanding the nuance of each updated policy so they apply rules consistently. We will likely conduct policy workshops and even have staff take quizzes or certifications to ensure understanding (especially for critical things like not accepting late renewals any more).
•	Gap in High-Level IT Management: MSLR as an entity doesn’t have a CIO or similar. To fill this, we’ll rely on the IR Ministry’s IT branch. One gap identified is cybersecurity monitoring – the system will generate logs, but someone needs to review them for suspicious activity. We may formalize an arrangement where the Service Alberta’s cybersecurity team includes MSLR’s system in their monitoring (many GoA systems have centralized monitoring). If not, training someone internally in at least basic review of logs is needed (this can be the Digital Systems Admin role mentioned). We want to ensure that the capacity to handle modern IT issues (like patching software, responding to any breach attempt) is in place. This might be addressed by continued part-time support from the development vendor in Year 2, and knowledge transfer to internal staff.
•	Communication & Change Management: Changing how people work can be challenging. We have to manage any resistance or anxiety among staff. We’ll emphasize that modernization is not about cutting jobs but about making their jobs easier and more meaningful. For instance, a clerk who used to spend hours typing can now focus on helping resolve tricky cases or improving member service. We’ll involve staff in design and give them a sense of ownership (some already contributed to drafting the new policies). Each staff will have a clear answer to “what’s my role in the new system” well before go-live to reduce uncertainty.
Staffing Proposal Summary: We do not propose to eliminate any positions; instead, every current staff member is retained and retrained for the digital environment. The overall staffing level (5 FTE) remains the same, which the budget accounts for. The major change is adding a temporary IT support contractor in Year 1 to help set up systems and train staff. By Year 2, this contractor role is phased out as internal staff and central ministry IT take over support (hence the drop in FTE cost). We also anticipate no new permanent hires are needed if training is successful – the automation gains allow the existing team to handle workload even as it grows. However, if down the line transaction volume increases dramatically, we may revisit staffing.
We highlight that a collaborative approach is needed: MSLR staff, Settlement staff, and external partners all have roles. For instance, rather than MSLR hiring a GIS specialist, we might coordinate with the Metis Settlements GIS technician (if MSGC employs one for Settlement planning) to assist with our map integration occasionally. Or rely on ARLO’s mapping team for complex issues. So part of our staffing strategy is leveraging relationships in the MSGC and GoA environment rather than siloing.
Finally, the staffing plan reinforces accountability and clarity. Each policy area could even be “owned” by a staff member as a subject matter expert (e.g., one clerk is the go-to for Policies 2–4 about PMTs, another for Policies 5–6 membership, etc.). This ensures depth of knowledge and that training of others can be done by the internal expert.
With these role adjustments and support, the MSLR team will be fully capable of running the new digital registry effectively. The approach follows the principle noted in the 2014 JARC report that building capacity and clarifying roles improves long-term sustainability[144][145]. We are doing exactly that: reinforcing the separation that Settlements handle member-facing advice while MSLR staff manage registry integrity[125][146], and equipping staff with the skills needed for their evolved roles in a digital-first registry.
6. Operational Guide for Staff: Procedures, Roles, and Fallback Protocols
To ensure smooth day-to-day functioning of the modernized MSLR, this section provides an Operational Guide outlining procedural steps for staff, definitions of roles in practice, how to use the new digital dashboard, and plans for emergencies or non-digital scenarios. This guide will serve as an internal “manual” for MSLR staff to refer to, complementing the policy book.
Daily Operational Workflow:
Each morning, an MSLR clerk (designated as duty officer of the day) will log into the MSLR portal and review the dashboard. The dashboard will show: new submissions awaiting review, any system alerts (e.g., a failed API check or a document needing manual verification), and approaching deadlines (like interests about to expire, objections nearing 15-day decision limit, etc.). The clerk will triage these items:
1.	New Submission Review: For each new transaction submitted (land transfer, PMT application, etc.), the system will have already done initial validation. The clerk opens the application in the staff interface, verifies that all looks in order and that required attachments (e.g., Council approvals, ID, payment) are present. In most cases of routine transactions, if no issues, the clerk can proceed to approve and register the transaction, which in the system might be clicking an “Approve” button. The system then finalizes the entry – assigns instrument number, generates a digital Métis Title or updated certificate, and sends notifications to relevant parties. The clerk double-checks the output (maybe spot-check the title PDF for correctness) before it goes out. This is a big change: previously, approving a transfer might involve manual stamping and signing; now it’s a quick system action, but staff oversight remains to ensure the automation did right.
2.	Deficiency Handling: If the clerk finds an issue (perhaps the user bypassed a check by uploading a blank document or a Council approval is illegible), they will initiate a deficiency notice via the system. The system likely has templates; the clerk selects the relevant reasons (e.g., “Missing Council signature on form”) and the system sends the notice to the applicant and Settlement office[75]. The clerk moves that submission to a “Pending – Deficient” queue. The clerk’s duty is then done until the corrected submission comes back. The portal allows the applicant to re-submit the corrected info, which will bring the item back as a new submission.
3.	Special Cases / Exceptions: Certain submissions will be flagged for Registrar attention – e.g., if a member’s submission triggers an acreage limit exceedance (Policy 10) or an unsurveyed land interest. These appear on the dashboard with a flag. The clerk will prepare a brief for the Registrar: summarizing the issue and attaching any supporting info. For example, “Member X’s transfer would put them at 5 quarters, above 4 quarter limit[97]. System suggests flagging; prepared notice to Council attached.” The Registrar can then decide (perhaps the Registrar will want to talk to MSGC or Council before proceeding). In operations, staff need a clear protocol: “Flagged transactions must be reviewed by Registrar within 2 business days.” The clerk ensures the Registrar is aware (could be as simple as an email or an in-system assignment).
4.	Notifications and Mailing: Part of operations is making sure all outgoing communications are sent. The system automates a lot (emails, portal notifications), but for anything requiring physical mail (like if a member hasn’t got an email on file and we need to send by regular post), the clerk will print those letters and put them in mail. For instance, weekly, a clerk might run a “Mailing list” report of any notices that need physical mailing (like 60-day letters for those without email)[36][147]. The clerk then prints and dispatches them, logging that done (although system logs when they were generated, a manual step ensures they indeed went out physically).
5.	Records and Archiving: Even with digital, certain documents (like original wills or court orders) might come in. Operationally, the staff will scan such documents into the system immediately and link them to the relevant record. The physical copy can then be filed in a minimal paper archive or returned if appropriate. We maintain paper backup for critical documents only during transition as Policy 8 indicates[82], but as an ongoing practice, scanning and digital storage is primary. Staff should daily ensure all incoming physical mail or in-person drop-offs are digitized and entered.
Role Definitions in Operations:
•	Registrar: In daily ops, the Registrar (or Deputy in Registrar’s absence) will check any items requiring approval or escalation. The system might have an “Admin Queue” for Registrar – such as corrections needing approval, objections filed, or policy exceptions. The Registrar should clear these promptly. The Registrar also is responsible for final review of any complex files and signing off system-generated outputs as needed (digitally). Additionally, the Registrar will periodically review audit logs – maybe once a week skim the log of all corrections made or any unusual access. The Registrar ensures the system decisions align with law, intervening when automation might not cover a nuance.
•	Clerks/Officers: They handle the bulk of processing as described. Additionally, each clerk might have an assigned specialty:
•	One might handle incoming land transaction requests,
•	Another handles membership-related changes (like Policy 5 terminations, name changes, etc.),
•	Another could handle notifications and expiries (managing the batch of 60-day letters, tracking PMTs due to expire). They cross-train but having primary leads ensures accountability. Clerks also manage the helpdesk: either rotate daily or have one clerk dedicated for a set time each day to respond to user calls/emails.
•	IT Coordinator (if internal or shared): They will run daily checks on system health – ensure overnight batch jobs (like backup or nightly sync with ARLO data) ran successfully. They address any technical glitch, or escalate to central IT if needed. They also manage user account administration – for example, if a Settlement hires a new land clerk, the IT Coordinator will set up their portal access and permissions. This role might also generate monthly usage stats for the team.
•	Settlement Clerks (external but in ops flow): From an operational view, Settlement clerks will do things like: verify member identity and witness signatures for any forms being submitted from their Settlement, upload council approval documents after each Council meeting for any land decisions, and coordinate with members who are not comfortable online by submitting on their behalf if absolutely needed (some Settlement offices might offer a service where the land clerk, with the member present, fills out the online form for them – allowed as long as proper consent and verification, essentially acting as their agent). Settlement clerks should check the portal regularly (they’ll have accounts) for any notifications or requests from MSLR (like “Please provide missing info for Member Y’s application”).
Digital Dashboard Functions:
The staff dashboard is a central feature that needs to be well-understood. Key functions likely include:
•	Task List: Shows all pending tasks categorized by type: e.g., “X new submissions pending review,” “Y awaiting Council approval,” “Z objections awaiting decision,” “N documents to mail,” etc. Staff will use this to prioritize daily work. For each task, the dashboard provides quick links to details.
•	Search & Retrieval: Staff can search the registry by various keys (member name, land description, instrument number). This is for answering inquiries or doing research. If a member calls asking about their file, a clerk can quickly find it on the system (much faster than digging paper).
•	Reporting: The system can generate routine reports. Operationally, at month-end, a clerk will run reports like “Number of registrations by Settlement” or “List of interests cancelled this month” to share with MSGC or Settlement Councils. There might be a dashboard view for key metrics as well.
•	Audit Log Access: Authorized staff (Registrar/Deputy) can view logs of all actions. This is useful if, say, there's a question “did we send that letter?” – the log will show on what date the system marked it sent and by whom. The operational guide instructs staff how to check these logs. It’s also used for security checks – e.g., if an account shows unusual behavior, staff know how to trace it.
•	Emergency Features: Possibly a “read-only mode” switch exists to be used if something’s wrong (for example, if a data issue is detected, the Registrar could put the system in read-only for users until resolved). Staff should know how to invoke any such emergency mode and communicate it to users.
Emergency Fallback Procedures:
Despite robust design, we must prepare for scenarios like system outages, power failures, or users who cannot access digital resources. Key fallback protocols:
•	System Outage (Unplanned): If the digital portal becomes unavailable (due to technical issues or cyber incident), MSLR will revert to manual processing temporarily. Staff will have on hand updated paper forms (we will maintain a small stock of current forms reflecting new policies). Members coming in or mailing in during outage will fill paper, and staff will timestamp and process as if pre-digital. The Registrar will instruct (via email/phone) all Settlement offices that until further notice, they should fax or email any urgent requests directly. Staff will log these in a simple spreadsheet or logbook. Once the system is restored, staff will enter those transactions into the system (with original dates preserved) to ensure the digital record is up-to-date. Policy-wise, all the same rules apply; we just do them without the computer’s help. We also have the disaster recovery site – if a primary data center outage occurs, IT will switch to the backup site with minimal downtime[141], but staff should be aware of communication: they might get an all-clear that “system is live on backup, continue use” or instructions if any differences.
•	Planned Downtime: Occasionally for maintenance we might schedule downtime (after hours ideally). Staff should know to announce this to users – e.g., post a notice on the portal login and inform Settlement offices “System will be down Sat 2am-6am” etc. If downtime overlaps any working hours, prepare to use manual processes for that window.
•	Data Discrepancy or Error: If staff suspect a system error (say the system calculated something wrongly or a bug is discovered), they should have authority to put a hold on affected transactions. For example, if the acreage calculator had a bug, staff would manually ensure no wrongful rejection is happening. The Registrar could issue a quick internal directive: “Until fixed, override this check manually.” Essentially, use human judgment if system misbehaves. All such incidents must be documented and reported to IT for fixing.
•	Non-Digital Client Service: Some members may never use the portal personally (due to age, preference, etc.). For these cases, counter service remains available but in a limited, assistive form. Operationally: if a member walks in with a completed form or just to do business, staff will either (a) guide them to a public computer in the office to submit electronically (helping as needed) or (b) accept a paper form and then enter it into the digital system on the member’s behalf. Policy 15 allows staff to provide procedural info and commission documents[146][148]. So if a member has a paper transfer form signed, staff can still process it – the clerk will log in and input the details into the system so that it’s registered. We won’t turn people away for not using the computer; rather, staff act as data entry in those rare cases. The key is that ultimately everything goes into the digital registry, even if initiated on paper.
•	Payment Processing: Currently MSLR might accept fees by cash/cheque. With the portal, online payment is likely (credit card or e-transfer). But for those who come in with cash or check, staff can receipt it and mark the transaction paid in the system via an admin interface. We’ll maintain a small safe for cash, as per finance policy, and deposit into appropriate accounts. If online payment is down for some reason, we’d communicate alternate methods (e.g., hold the transaction in pending until payment can go through, or accept cheque temporarily).
•	Security Breach or Data Issue: In case a security alert triggers (like an unauthorized access attempt flagged by the system[136]), the procedure might be to immediately inform the IT security team and possibly suspend new transactions until assured safe. Staff should have an emergency contact list (Department IT Security, ARLO security liaison, etc.). We’ll treat personal data seriously: if for example a member’s data got exposed incorrectly, have a plan to notify the member and rectify. These steps are more IT-specific, but staff need awareness: e.g., if someone calls claiming they see someone else’s info, that’s red alert – escalate to Registrar and IT at once.
•	Loss of Key Personnel: As a smaller office, if the Registrar is unavailable (illness, etc.), the Deputy steps in. All staff should know the delegation in place (the Registrar formally delegates signing authority to Deputy via MSLR Reg s.57 if needed[149]). Similarly, cross-training ensures if one clerk is out, another can handle their queue.
Procedural Example – End-to-End Land Transfer: To illustrate operational steps in a typical scenario under the new system:
1.	Initiation: Member A wants to transfer a Métis Title to Member B. They log into the portal (or visit Settlement office for help) and fill the Transfer form, including uploading the signed transfer instrument and proof of Council’s approval (Council resolution or consent form per local bylaw). They submit, paying the fee online. They immediately get a submission confirmation number.
2.	MSLR Processing: Clerk sees “New Transfer Submission #123 – Settlement: Paddle Prairie” on dashboard. Clerk opens it, verifies: Are both parties members? (The system should have checked membership status via the integrated members list; if one wasn’t, it would have flagged or prevented submission). Is Council approval attached? Yes, a PDF of council motion is there. Any outstanding issues (like does this put the acquirer over acreage limit)? The system indicates “OK” or flags. Suppose it’s fine. Clerk then formally accepts and approves the transfer in the system.
3.	Registration: The system assigns a new title number to Member B and moves Member A’s prior title to historical. It generates a digital title certificate (PDF with e-signature of Registrar) and logs the date/time of registration. The clerk checks the certificate on screen. The clerk then triggers the notices: the system sends Member B an email “You are now the registered holder, see attached certificate” and Member A a confirmation of transfer. The Settlement Council gets notified the transfer was completed (they often need to know for local records). Because the system is integrated, if any government monitoring (like IR needs a report of Settlement land transactions), it could be flagged too.
4.	Completion: The clerk’s dashboard now removes that from pending. The clerk might physically print a copy of the title to mail to Member B if they requested a hard copy (some members may want a paper certificate – which we can provide as a print of the digital record). The entire process likely took a day or two instead of weeks.
5.	Post-Checks: The next day, another staff or the Deputy might do a quick quality review: sample one or two processed transactions to ensure everything was correct (like double-check that the Council approval date matched what was entered, etc.). We build this into operations for the first few months to ensure the new system’s outputs are reliable.
Emergency Fallback for the Example: If during that transfer scenario the portal went down right when the member tried to submit, the Settlement clerk could help them fill a paper form and fax/email to MSLR. MSLR clerk would use the old method to log it (time stamp the fax) and once system is up, enter it with original timestamp. The member’s rights are preserved.
Continuous Operations and Service:
We will maintain an Operations Log/Diary – a daily record briefly noting any unusual events (system down time, number of submissions, issues encountered). This helps in troubleshooting and in handover between staff shifts.
We also plan periodic drills for certain scenarios. For example, a disaster recovery drill: simulate loss of system and practice using paper for a day, then recovering. This may sound extreme, but it’s part of ensuring readiness (especially with the importance of land records, we want zero loss). Similarly, maybe test an evacuation scenario (if MSLR office inaccessible, can staff work remotely via secure connection? Given digital system, theoretically yes – Registrar or deputy could approve things from another location if needed. We’ll set up at least one secure laptop to allow remote admin access if office is closed due to weather or etc.).
Non-Digital Cases / Accessibility:
We remain inclusive. If an Elder cannot use the system or travel, they might authorize someone (family or Settlement staff) to act for them. We accept properly authorized third-party submissions (e.g., power of attorney or proxy) – operations will verify the authorization and then treat that agent as the user in system (we can create agent accounts or let staff input noting “on behalf of X”). Additionally, for languages or literacy issues, we have all materials in plain language and can provide verbal explanations. The help center could include short videos explaining processes in easy terms, which staff can also show on a tablet or laptop when visiting communities.
In summary, the operational procedures ensure that technology enhances but does not hinder service. Every digital step has a human fallback. Staff are empowered to override or supplement the system where needed to uphold the spirit of the policies and serve members. The goal is a resilient operation that maintains continuity of the Land Registry under any circumstance, thereby upholding the trust placed in MSLR to manage Métis Settlement land records securely and effectively.
Conclusion: Through this comprehensive proposal – covering rationale, policy consolidation, budget, implementation, staffing, and operations – the Metis Settlements Land Registry will enter 2025–2026 fully modernized. This aligns with legal mandates like MSA s.106 and the MSGC Land Policy while leveraging Alberta’s ARLO innovation[11]. The two-year plan is ambitious but achievable, and by its conclusion, we will have a digitally transformed MSLR that offers faster, more reliable, and transparent services to Métis Settlement members and administrators. This modernization not only yields cost savings and efficiency[138][139], but also strengthens self-governance by giving Settlements better tools to manage their lands in partnership with the registry. The careful training and role alignment ensure that staff – our most important resource – are ready to carry the registry into this new era. In the end, the land registry is more than a database; it is the record of the Métis community’s homeland. This proposal ensures that record is protected, accessible, and well-managed for generations to come, using the best of modern technology under the guidance of enduring Métis laws and policies.

Metis Settlements Land Registry Modernization Policy Book Proposal (2025–2026)
Executive Summary
The Metis Settlements Land Registry (MSLR) is the statutory system for recording land interests on Alberta’s Metis Settlements, established under the Metis Settlements Act (MSA) in the early 1990s. After three decades of operation, modernization is needed to integrate accumulated policy directives, reflect current law and Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC) Land Policies, and implement digital transformation in line with Government of Alberta standards. This proposal presents a Consolidated 2025 Edition MSLR Policy Book alongside a modernization plan that aligns with Alberta Land Titles’ new ARLO (Alberta Registries for Land Online) digital system[1]. It aims to enhance efficiency, legal compliance, and user service while respecting Métis self-governance and protecting Settlement lands.
Key objectives of the modernization include: ensuring all registry functions comply with the MSA, MSLR Regulation, and MSGC policies; transitioning to a digital-first registry portal with robust security; automating statutory rules (e.g. land holding caps, expiry deadlines) to reduce errors; improving interoperability with other government systems; and reinforcing local accountability (Settlement Council approvals, MSGC oversight) in land transactions. The proposal outlines strategic goals, required legislative references and amendments, an implementation roadmap, and an updated MSLR Policy Framework (16 policies) that consolidates 2005–2014 practice directives with new digital standards.
By adopting this modernization plan, the Government of Alberta and the Metis Settlements will benefit from a clearer, more secure and efficient land registry. The plan mitigates current issues such as processing backlogs, incomplete submissions, and data risks, and introduces features like online submissions, automated notifications, and audit trails. It preserves the core principle that Metis Settlement lands remain collectively protected and governed by Settlement members: all substantive decisions (e.g. subdivisions, large land allocations) still require Settlement Council or General Council approval under the MSA. The Accountability structure is strengthened through defined roles for the MSLR Registrar (a public service appointment under MSA s.103[2]), Settlement Councils, MSGC, and the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) for dispute resolution.
This document is prepared in a Government of Alberta business plan format for Cabinet consideration. It includes an introduction to the current framework, the rationale for modernization, strategic objectives, a detailed policy update (with context, implementation steps and impacts for each policy area), an implementation plan and accountability framework, and appendices with legislative and policy references. Approval of this proposal will authorize the implementation of the MSLR digital portal and adoption of the consolidated policy book, as well as any necessary regulatory amendments (e.g. to enforce land caps) in coordination with MSGC. Ultimately, this modernization will secure the integrity of Métis Settlement lands and improve services for members, aligning the MSLR with modern land registry standards while honoring Métis self-governance and land rights.
Introduction & Background
MSLR Overview: The Metis Settlements Land Registry (MSLR) was established as part of the Metis Settlements Accord legislation in 1990 and is governed by Part 9 of the Metis Settlements Act (RSA 2000, c M-14) and the Metis Settlements Land Registry Regulation (Alta. Reg. 361/1991). The MSLR is a distinct land titles system for Metis Settlement lands, separate from the provincial Land Titles registry, reflecting the unique legal status of Settlement lands (held collectively for members). The MSLR records Métis Title, Provisional Métis Title (PMT), Allotment and other interests of settlement members, and it maintains the Settlement Members List (official roll of members with land interests). The Registrar of MSLR is appointed under the Public Service Act (MSA s.103) and operates the registry on behalf of the Minister of Indigenous Relations in collaboration with the MSGC and Settlement Councils[3].
Need for Modernization: Over the past 30 years, land governance on the Settlements has evolved, and various practice directives and policies were issued to address emerging issues. Between 2005 and 2014, at least 16 numbered policy directives (MSLR Policy Guides) were developed to clarify procedures on matters such as notice of expiry of interests, handling objections, membership termination, incomplete filings, digital mapping, etc. However, these policies were never consolidated into a single up-to-date document, leading to fragmentation and inconsistent application. Additionally, the MSGC Land Policy (the General Council’s policy on land management) has introduced rules – for example, limits on the amount of land a member may hold – that needed integration with MSLR procedures.
Current Challenges: The MSLR still relies partly on dated technology and manual processes. For instance, spatial data have been stored in stand-alone AutoCAD files, and many transactions require paper forms or in-person assistance. This has resulted in inefficiencies and risks, such as backlogs in processing membership terminations and uncertainties in applying policies (e.g. inconsistent handling of expired PMTs and objections in the past). A 2019 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) assessment identified data integrity and disaster recovery gaps in the registry’s IT system, and user feedback highlighted difficulties in accessing services for remote members (the “digital divide”). Moreover, the Government of Alberta’s land registry system is undergoing a major digital upgrade (the ARLO program) to move to a cloud-based, online service model[1]. The MSLR must align with these standards to ensure compatibility (for example, integrating Settlement survey plans into the new provincial parcel mapping system) and to improve service delivery to Settlement members.
Prior Modernization Efforts: Some improvements have been implemented incrementally. By 2015, the registry had introduced a basic electronic database for records. Practice directives were issued to stop certain old practices (e.g. as of 2006, discontinuing registered mail for 60-day notices in favor of regular mail with a presumed receipt after 7 days[4]) and to automate courtesy reminders for expiries. The Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) has been engaged to handle objections to cancellations more directly, ensuring members have recourse. Despite these efforts, a comprehensive modernization – both in policy consolidation and in technological infrastructure – had not been fully realized.
Proposal Summary: This proposal outlines a comprehensive modernization of the MSLR. It consolidates all relevant policies into a Modernized MSLR Policy Book (2025 Edition), ensuring consistency with the MSA, the MSLR Regulation, and MSGC policies. It also describes the implementation of the MSLR Digital Portal, a secure online system modeled after Alberta Land Titles’ ARLO portal, which will allow members and officials to conduct transactions online with proper access controls. The modernization is designed to uphold Métis self-governance: Settlement Councils retain authority for approving key steps (subdivisions, new surveys, etc.), and the MSGC continues to set overarching land policy (with any required amendments coordinated accordingly). The land protection objectives enshrined in the MSA – keeping Settlement land within the community and preventing unintended loss of land rights – remain paramount. For example, the proposal strengthens measures to prevent unauthorized land fragmentation and to ensure expired or invalid interests are properly cancelled only after due notice and opportunity for objection, as required by law[5][6].
In summary, the modernization will bring the MSLR to a professional standard on par with other GoA registries, improve efficiency and accessibility for users, and embed safeguards to protect the integrity of Metis Settlement lands and member rights.
Legislative and Policy Framework
A successful modernization must operate within – and where necessary update – the existing legislative framework governing Metis Settlements land registration. Key components of this framework include:
•	Metis Settlements Act (MSA) – The MSA is the foundational statute. It establishes the MSLR and empowers the creation of regulations for its operation. Notably, MSA section 102 authorizes regulations respecting the recording, registration, and filing of interests in Settlement lands and the establishment of an assurance fund, among other matters[7]. MSA section 103 provides for the appointment of the MSLR Registrar and necessary staff[3]. The MSA also contains provisions tying land interests to membership: for instance, MSA section 95 stipulates that when a person’s Settlement membership is terminated, their land interests terminate as well. In addition, MSA section 98 restricts access to the Settlement Members List to authorized persons, which underpins privacy and role-based access rules in the registry.
•	Metis Settlements Land Registry Regulation (AR 361/91) – This regulation details the procedures for land registration. It specifies the types of interests that can be recorded or registered and the processes for cancellation, amendment, etc. Several sections are particularly relevant to this proposal:
•	Section 29(1) of the Regulation sets out grounds on which the Registrar may refuse to register an instrument. Currently, exceeding MSGC land holding limits is not an explicit ground, which is why the MSLR cannot outright reject a transaction solely for that reason without a regulatory amendment (as noted later in Policy 10).
•	Section 30 governs expiries and cancellations. For example, s.30(1)(b) and 30(2) provide that Provisional Métis Title (PMT) registrations expire after a set term unless timely renewed (with fees), effectively requiring renewal by a deadline. Section 30(1)(j), read with MSA s.95, provides that a member’s interests are cancelled if their membership is terminated.
•	Section 73(1)(a)(ii) requires the Registrar to notify a holder if their interest “appears to have expired” and states that the Registrar will cancel the interest unless the holder objects within 60 days of the notice being sent[5]. This is the legal basis for the “60-day notice letters” in Policy 2 of the attached book. After the 60-day period with no objection, the Registrar may proceed to cancel the interest[6].
•	Section 18 and Section 20 of the Regulation (notably referenced in older policies) deal with referring disputes to the MSAT and cancellation of allocations in certain circumstances (e.g. unsubstantiated allocation claims can be cancelled by Registrar under s.20). These are relevant to allocation interests (Policy 12).
•	Section 57(1) allows the Registrar to delegate certain powers (and indeed a 2004 delegation letter under this section was implemented, as per MSLR files, to delegate authority to a Deputy Registrar for routine sign-offs).
As part of modernization, targeted amendments to the Regulation may be sought. For example, to explicitly allow the Registrar to enforce MSGC land holding limits on PMTs/Allotments (treating them similar to Métis Title caps) – presently, as noted, that would require adding a ground in s.29 or a new regulatory provision. The proposal does not immediately depend on such changes (the Registry will flag and report over-limit transactions), but it recommends the government and MSGC work together on regulatory updates for consistency with policy (see Appendix A for a list of suggested amendments).
•	MSGC Land Policy – The Metis Settlements General Council Land Policy (most recently revised in the 2000s) is a binding policy on Settlements concerning land management. Under the MSA, General Council Policies have force of law on settlements once enacted. The MSGC Land Policy covers rules such as:
•	Limits on Land Holdings: The policy imposes acreage caps on the amount of land a member can hold in Métis Title. Currently, the general rule is a member may hold up to 175 acres of land in Métis Title, with a possibility of one additional parcel (up to ~167 acres) for approved purposes like a farm, ranch, or business, bringing the effective maximum to approximately 342 acres. It also limits members to one hamlet lot for residential purposes. These limits ensure equitable distribution of land among members. The policy modernization (see Policy 10) acknowledges these caps: the MSLR will enforce the cap on new Métis Title registrations and flag any transaction that would put a member over the limit. Full enforcement on PMTs requires either a regulatory change or a change to MSGC policy (the General Council may consider amending its Land Policy and working with the Minister to adjust the Regulation accordingly).
•	Estate Instructions: MSGC Land Policy provides a framework for estate instructions (wills or designations regarding settlement land) – for example, section 7.8 of the Land Policy outlines how a deceased member’s land interest should be handled in accordance with the Act. The consolidated Policy 9 aligns with these requirements, ensuring estate instructions are honored and remain confidential until needed.
•	Other Provisions: The Land Policy also covers procedures for issuing new interests (allocations, PMTs), requiring Settlement Council approvals for certain actions like subdivisions or significant land use changes. It allows appeals or referrals to MSAT on land disputes – e.g., section 8.2 of the Land Policy states that questions about ownership or extent of an interest may be referred to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal[8][9]. This underpins the role of MSAT in hearing objections (Policy 3) and other disputes.
•	Settlement Bylaws: Each Settlement may pass local bylaws (subject to MSGC and Ministerial approvals) affecting land administration – for example, bylaws on community land use or internal procedures. The MSLR policies must be applied consistently with any Settlement-specific bylaws, though in practice most land procedures are governed by the general MSLR framework. Where a Settlement bylaw imposes additional requirements (for instance, a local Council might have a bylaw on membership consultation for land transfers), the Registrar will respect such bylaws provided they do not conflict with the MSA or general policy. MSLR staff will verify any local bylaw requirements case-by-case.
•	Other Relevant Legislation: The Surveys Act (Alberta) is applicable for survey standards on Settlement lands – Policy 13 mandates that all survey plans meet Alberta Survey standards and be signed by an Alberta Land Surveyor, ensuring legal traceability of boundaries. Privacy legislation (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, FOIP) also applies to the personal information in the MSLR (e.g., the Members List), reinforcing the need for strict access controls (reflected in Policy 6 and Policy 16). Additionally, interoperability with systems like the Personal Property Registry (for registering any security interests on settlement land, if allowed) must comply with those systems’ governing laws.
This modernization proposal has been developed to comply with all the above legal requirements. Appendix A provides a summary of specific MSA sections, Regulation provisions, and MSGC policy references mapped to each Policy area. Where changes to law or policy are recommended (e.g., clarifying the acreage cap in the Regulation), those are identified for further action but do not hold up the immediate policy implementation. The approach is to implement what can be done under current law and policy, while pursuing any amendments in parallel through the proper channels (General Council resolutions and Ministerial regulations process as per MSA sections 239–240[10][11]).
Modernization Rationale
The rationale for modernizing the MSLR can be summarized in five main drivers:
1.	Legal Compliance and Clarity: The MSLR must strictly uphold the Metis Settlements Act, regulation, and MSGC policies to ensure the integrity of land transactions. In the past, ambiguities or lack of consolidated guidance led to inconsistent practices – for instance, uncertainty around sending expiry notices resulted in some expired interests lingering without cancellation[5][12]. Modernization resolves these issues by codifying clear policies (e.g., always send 60-day notices and act on them) and eliminating outdated practices. It also integrates Vicklund vs. Peavine Settlement and other case law principles by providing fair processes (Policy 5 on membership termination acknowledges there are exceptions and fairness considerations before cancelling interests). Ultimately, having one authoritative policy book reduces confusion for staff and members, ensuring legal supremacy of the MSA and consistency across all Settlements.
2.	Digital Transformation and Efficiency: Aligning with the GoA’s digital strategy, the MSLR will move to a digital-first model. Every common transaction – from applying for Métis Title to submitting a survey plan – will be possible through an online portal. This drastically reduces turnaround times (e.g., automated checks will catch incomplete submissions instantly, rather than weeks of back-and-forth mail). Automation of routine statutory checks (expiry dates, member status, land caps calculations) minimizes human error and speeds up processing. The ARLO-inspired design allows integration with geospatial data and other registries for one-stop processing. However, recognizing connectivity challenges for some users, the policy remains “paper-permitted” – meaning traditional paper submissions are accepted when necessary, so no member is left out. Efficiency gains will allow MSLR staff to focus on complex issues rather than manual data entry or chasing paperwork.
3.	Enhanced Member Services and Accessibility: The modernization is user-centered. Settlement members, settlement councils, and other stakeholders (e.g., surveyors, the Minister’s office) will have secure access to the system appropriate to their role. This includes features like personal dashboards showing pending items (e.g., a member can see if their PMT is nearing expiry), guided e-forms that reduce errors, and real-time status tracking of requests. A help center with resources like how-to videos and even chatbot support will empower users to self-serve for common tasks, addressing the digital literacy gap with supportive tools. Importantly, multi-channel communication is maintained: critical notices (like the 60-day expiry letters) will go out via mail and digitally (for those opted in), ensuring maximum reach. By improving service delivery, the registry enhances trust – members can more easily exercise their rights (such as filing an objection to a cancellation within the allowed time) because the process is transparent and accessible.
4.	Protection of Settlement Land and Member Interests: A core goal is safeguarding land protection objectives inherent in the Metis Settlements system. Modernized policies put strong checks on any action that could alienate Settlement land improperly. For example, Policy 1 prevents partial interests from being registered without a prior subdivision approval, thereby avoiding unapproved fragmentation of Settlement land. Policies 2–4 ensure that members do not lose their land interests due to mere administrative oversight: automated reminders and clear notice processes help prevent accidental expiries, and formal objection and appeal channels guard members’ rights to be heard. Policy 9 (Estate Instructions) ensures that upon a member’s passing, their designated successors receive the land according to their wishes and legal requirements, preventing disputes and keeping land within the community/family as intended. Policy 10 (Land Holding Limits) promotes equitable land distribution by enforcing the MSGC’s caps, preventing over-accumulation by any single member to the detriment of others. All these measures contribute to preserving the Settlement land base collectively for present and future generations of Métis.
5.	Strengthening Accountability and Métis Governance: The modernization clarifies roles and upholds the principle that local Métis institutions have control over their lands. Settlement Councils are explicitly integrated in processes requiring their decision: e.g., no subdivision registration without council approval, no new survey plan accepted without council sanction, etc. The digital system will notify councils of relevant actions (like a member applying to convert an allocation to title) so they are always in the loop. At the same time, the line between the registry’s administrative function and the political/governance function is more clearly drawn – Policy 15 delineates that MSLR staff will no longer perform quasi-advisory roles or handle tasks that properly belong to Settlement council offices (such as filling forms or verifying membership eligibility). This ensures accountability at the right level: MSLR focuses on accurate and efficient registrations, while settlements and MSGC handle governance decisions and member support. An audit trail of all transactions and changes (Policy 16’s security features) provides transparency; any access or alteration in the system is logged and can be reviewed, which builds trust among the communities that the system is fair and secure. The accountability structure is further enhanced by involving MSAT for independent adjudication of disputes or objections, ensuring decisions can be challenged and reviewed in a fair forum.
In summary, modernizing the MSLR is not merely a technical upgrade; it is a holistic improvement to ensure the registry fulfills its purpose as a guardian of Métis Settlement lands and a service to Settlement members. It brings the operation up to modern standards of efficiency and security, addresses long-standing pain points, and reinforces the partnership between the Government of Alberta and Metis Settlements in land administration. The rationale is clear: without these changes, the registry would continue to face legal risks (e.g., improper cancellations or registrations), slow service, and potential erosion of confidence. With modernization, the MSLR will be a robust pillar supporting Métis self-governance and community prosperity.
Strategic Objectives
To guide the modernization initiative, the following strategic objectives have been identified. These objectives align with both Government of Alberta priorities (modernizing service delivery, Indigenous partnership) and the Metis Settlements’ goals of self-reliance and land protection:
•	1. Ensure Legal Supremacy and Compliance: All MSLR operations and decisions will strictly adhere to the MSA, MSLR Regulation, MSGC Land Policy, and Settlement bylaws. Where ambiguities exist, clear policies (or recommended amendments) are put in place to provide direction. This objective ensures the registry’s actions are legally sound and defensible, maintaining the rule of law in land transactions. Success indicator: 100% of registrations and cancellations are executed with cited legislative authority or policy basis (tracked via internal audits).
•	2. Implement a Digital-First Service Model: Launch a secure online MSLR Digital Portal that enables end-to-end electronic processing of land registry transactions, while still permitting paper-based submissions as a backup. By adopting digital workflows, the registry will reduce processing times and improve accessibility. This includes digitization of all legacy records and integration with geospatial mapping. Success indicator: By 2026, at least 80% of transactions are initiated and completed through the digital portal.
•	3. Automate and Streamline Registry Processes: Introduce automated checks and workflows to enforce business rules (e.g., prevent incomplete applications, flag acreage limit issues, track deadlines) and eliminate unnecessary manual intervention. Standardize forms and require complete submissions to avoid processing delays. The objective is to streamline operations, reduce backlogs, and minimize human error. Success indicator: Reduction in incomplete or deficient submissions by 90% (due to upfront portal validation) and elimination of historical backlogs (e.g., old pending membership termination files cleared).
•	4. Enhance Data Integrity, Security, and Sovereignty: Modernize the IT infrastructure to store all data in secure GoA data centers located in Alberta. Implement robust cybersecurity measures: role-based access control (enforcing MSA s.98 permissions), multi-factor authentication for users, encryption of data, and regular security audits. Ensure disaster recovery by maintaining redundant backups (e.g., real-time replication to a secondary site) to prevent data loss. Success indicator: Zero significant security breaches; system uptime at 99.9%; recovery drills demonstrate full data restoration capability.
•	5. Improve Interoperability and Integration: Connect the MSLR system via secure APIs or data exchange agreements with relevant external systems:
o	Alberta Land Titles (ARLO) – for verifying legal land descriptions and integrating the Settlement parcel map into the provincial mapping fabric[13].
o	Indigenous Services Canada’s Indian Lands Registry/Indian Register – to cross-check any referenced interests and ensure compliance with federal interests under MSA s.90 where applicable[13].
o	Alberta Personal Property Registry – to allow registration or searching of any charges or liens affecting Settlement land (if permitted by law)[13]. These integrations will reduce duplication of data entry and improve accuracy (e.g., automatically validating a survey plan against the official coordinate system). Success indicator: Functional data linkages established with at least two major external systems (ARLO and one other) by project’s end.
•	6. Deliver User-Centered Services and Support: Design all processes with the end-user in mind, whether that user is a Settlement member applying for a land interest, a Settlement Land Clerk facilitating an application, or a government official. Provide clear guidance at every step (tooltips, sample documents, FAQ), timely communications (email alerts, portal notifications), and multi-channel support. Address the digital divide by offering training sessions in communities, maintaining a helpdesk, and ensuring that those without internet access can be accommodated (through either Settlement office support or paper processes). Success indicator: User satisfaction ratings above 85% in surveys; demonstrable uptake of self-service resources (e.g., help center usage statistics).
•	7. Uphold Métis Self-Governance and Community Control: Ensure that modernization strengthens, rather than diminishes, local governance. This means any action requiring community approval remains so – the system will route such requests to the appropriate Council or MSGC authority. It also means respecting culturally appropriate protocols (e.g., confidentiality of certain documents like estate instructions until needed). The registry staff will refocus on registry duties and avoid encroaching on membership or political matters, leaving those to Settlement institutions (as clarified in Policy 15). Success indicator: Positive feedback from MSGC and Settlement councils that the new system supports their decision-making (qualitative, via feedback sessions); zero instances of Registry acting beyond its authority in membership or land allocation decisions.
Each of these strategic objectives is tied to specific initiatives and policies described in the next sections. Together, they ensure that the modernization is comprehensive – covering technology, process, people, and governance aspects. This alignment with both technical goals and foundational principles (legal, user-centric, self-governance) will guide implementation and help measure success.
Foundational Principles for Modernized MSLR
To translate the above objectives into practical policy and system design, the following Foundational Principles have been adopted. These principles underpin every policy and decision in the modernization and serve as a checklist to ensure fidelity to our goals:
•	Legal Supremacy: All Registry functions must comply with applicable laws and policies. The MSLR will operate strictly under the authority of the Metis Settlements Act, MSLR Regulation, MSGC Land Policy, Surveys Act, privacy laws, and any relevant Settlement bylaws. Where conflicts arise, the hierarchy of law prevails (MSA and Regulation take precedence, followed by MSGC policy and Settlement bylaw). Implication: Any new feature or policy is vetted for legal compliance; staff are trained on the legislative basis of their work.
•	Digital-First, Paper-Permitted: Every transaction can be completed via the MSLR Digital Portal as the preferred method, but paper submissions are accepted where a client lacks reliable online access or where original physical documents are legally or culturally required (e.g., original signed wills for estate instructions). This principle ensures modernization does not exclude anyone and recognizes the transitional period where not all users are online. Implication: Dual channels (online and offline) will run in parallel, with a gradual shift to majority digital. Paper forms will be scanned into the system to maintain a single source of record.
•	Role-Based Access & Auditability: System access is role-controlled and fully auditable. Only authorized persons can access certain information (e.g., only authorized staff and leaders can see the full Members List, per MSA s.98). The system will enforce user permissions (for members, councilors, clerks, etc.) and log every action – every view, submission, approval, or edit is recorded with user ID and timestamp. This creates an audit trail ensuring transparency and accountability for all registry activities. Implication: Comprehensive logs and periodic audits will deter unauthorized use and provide confidence that any irregularity can be traced.
•	Automation of Rules & Business Processes: Statutory and policy rules are embedded in the system to execute automatically wherever possible. For example, acreage caps, checking for required prior approvals (subdivision must be approved before partial interest registration), membership status verification, document completeness checks, and expiration date tracking will all happen automatically at the submission stage. This reduces staff discretion in routine compliance checks and ensures consistent enforcement of rules. That said, automation will respect legal limits – if a rule cannot be fully enforced due to current law (e.g., cannot reject an over-limit PMT), the system will flag it for human review rather than auto-reject (as noted in Policy 10). Implication: The portal essentially becomes a smart assistant, catching errors or violations early. Staff time is freed for cases that truly need judgment or exceptions.
•	Inter-Government Interoperability: The MSLR will not operate in isolation but will securely connect with other government systems for greater efficiency. Through secure APIs or data exchanges, the MSLR can validate or share information with:
•	The Alberta Land Titles (ARLO) system – e.g., for verifying parcel coordinates and legal descriptions against the provincial cadastral map[13].
•	Indigenous Services Canada systems – e.g., to verify if any actions conflict with federal registries or if a person appears in the Indian Register (relevant for s.90 MSA which concerns individuals registered under the Indian Act)[13].
•	Personal Property Registry (PPR) – e.g., to register security interests like mortgages or liens against Settlement land interests if required[13]. Such interoperability avoids duplication of data entry and helps maintain consistency. Implication: Where possible, the system will fetch/verify data from external sources (with proper security and consent) instead of requiring manual cross-referencing.
•	User-Centered Service: The design and policies prioritize the needs of end-users (members, settlement staff, etc.) for a positive experience. This means the interface must be intuitive, communications should be clear and in plain language, and support readily available. Members, councilors, and other users each get tailored dashboards and forms relevant to their needs. There will be features like guided form inputs (reducing errors), status tracking, and proactive notifications (reminders, updates). A comprehensive help center, chatbot, and even the ability to call support ensures that even those less tech-savvy can navigate the system – bridging the digital divide concerns. Implication: Ongoing user testing and feedback collection will be part of the implementation to continuously improve usability. The service must accommodate elders and others who may prefer personal assistance (through Settlement offices, not the registry itself giving advice, per Policy 15).
•	Data Sovereignty & Security: All MSLR data is treated as highly sensitive and is stored within Alberta under government custody. Data sovereignty is crucial given the cultural importance of land records to the Metis Settlements. The data will reside on secure GoA servers in Alberta, with encryption in transit and at rest. A secondary backup will be maintained in another Alberta government data center to ensure disaster recovery capability (learning from risk assessments that identified data corruption/loss as a risk). Cybersecurity is paramount: regular vulnerability assessments and security audits will be conducted, mirroring best practices from ARLO’s iterative development. Implication: The registry will comply with FOIP and GoA security classifications (Protected A for personal data, etc.), giving confidence that member information and land records are safe from unauthorized access or catastrophic loss.
These foundational principles have guided the development of the Modernized MSLR Policy Book (2025 Edition) and the overall project plan. They are in harmony with the strategic objectives and provide a lens through which any future changes should be evaluated. In effect, they form the “constitution” of the MSLR modernization – any detailed policy or implementation step should reflect one or more of these principles.
Modernized MSLR Policy Framework (2025 Edition)
Introduction to Policy Framework: The following section presents the Modernized MSLR Policy Book, Consolidated 2025 Edition, which is the core output of this initiative. This policy book integrates statutory requirements, past practice directives (circa 2005–2014), MSGC Land Policy provisions, and new digital standards (adapted from the Alberta Land Titles modern ARLO program) into a comprehensive set of policies. Each policy in this framework has a consistent format – Context (background and rationale), Policy Statement (the rule or standard being set), Implementation (how it will be put into practice), and Impacts (anticipated results or consequences). Dates of original approvals and recent updates are noted to show continuity from past directives.
These policies collectively will govern how the MSLR operates going forward. They have been reviewed by the MSLR Registrar and, once approved through the appropriate channels (e.g., by the Registrar’s authority and any higher approvals as required for policy adoption), will be implemented via registry procedures and the digital system configuration.
Note: Some policies reference other policies by number (for example, Policy 7 on incomplete requests is cited in other policies). This reflects the internal coherence of the policy framework. The numbering largely follows the chronological order of earlier directives, but all policies have been updated as of July 25, 2025, to reflect current practice and modernization changes.
Policy 1 – Partial Interests – Recording & Subdivision Approval
Date of Original Approval: April 14, 2005    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Historically, partial interest transactions (e.g. a member gifting or selling a part of their land interest parcel) were sometimes recorded in the MSLR prior to obtaining an official subdivision approval. This led to situations where land interests were fragmented on paper without proper surveys or council oversight. The Metis Settlements Act (MSA) section 106 now clearly requires Settlement Council subdivision approval before any registration of a partial interest in land (since subdividing affects the land parcel itself)[14][15]. This policy aligns MSLR practice with that statutory requirement and prevents premature or unauthorized fragmentation of Settlement lands. It reflects the principle that Settlement Councils control land use and parcel creation in their territory.
Policy Statement: The MSLR shall not record or register any partial interest in a Settlement landholding unless the request is accompanied by a duly approved subdivision plan issued by the appropriate Settlement Council. In other words, if a member wishes to transfer part of their land (e.g. half of a parcel) to someone else, the land must first be subdivided with Council approval into separate legal parcels. MSLR will reject any submissions attempting to deal with a portion of a parcel that has not been formally subdivided.
•	Submissions that include only a proposed or conditionally approved subdivision plan (i.e., not fully approved) will be rejected and returned with a deficiency notice, citing that subdivision approval is required. This follows the general rule in Policy 7 – Incomplete Requests that incomplete or conditional submissions are not acceptable[16][17].
•	Partial interest transactions completed prior to this policy (before 2005) that resulted in de facto subdivisions without approval are grandfathered for the time being; they remain in the registry but are flagged for review. The Registrar may coordinate with Settlements to formally rectify those cases (e.g., obtain ex post facto subdivision or otherwise regularize the interest) in the future.
Implementation: MSLR staff will verify, for any instrument transferring or creating an interest in “part of” a parcel, that a corresponding subdivision plan (showing the new parcel boundaries) has been approved by the Settlement Council under MSA s.106. This verification involves: - Checking that a Council Resolution or approval document is attached, and it corresponds to a survey or plan of subdivision. - Confirming the plan is registered or registerable (e.g., signed by an Alberta Land Surveyor and meeting Survey standards).
The MSLR Digital Portal will enforce this by requiring an upload of the approved subdivision plan for any submission that indicates a partial interest transaction. The portal will have an automated check: if a user selects a transaction type indicating only a portion of a land holding is involved, the system prompts for a subdivision approval document. It will validate the plan against Alberta Survey standards and, if possible, cross-reference the ARLO parcel fabric to ensure the new parcel is defined correctly spatially[18][19].
Settlement Land Clerks (the administrative staff at each Settlement) should be trained to assist members in obtaining Council approval and preparing the necessary plan before the member submits anything to MSLR. Essentially, any partial transfer needs to go through the local Council first; the Clerk can help package that approval with the submission to MSLR to avoid delays. MSLR will communicate this requirement clearly in its client guides and checklists.
Impacts: This policy ensures compliance with MSA s.106, thereby safeguarding the legal integrity of land transactions on Settlements[20][21]. By preventing registration of unsanctioned partial transfers, it: - Protects Settlement land from fragmentation without community consent, supporting land management goals and the collective land base. Unauthorized splitting of parcels could undermine land use plans and equity among members; this policy closes that door. - Encourages proper planning: Members and Councils will engage in proper subdivision planning (surveys, etc.) before any division of land interests, improving record accuracy. - Operationally, this may slightly increase the upfront work (members must go to Council first), but it avoids much bigger complications later (like disputes over unapproved partial interests). - The digital integration of subdivision plans should reduce processing delays, as everything is submitted together. However, it does require that members and councils have capacity to produce digital plans. There may be a need for training or resources for some councils to handle digital plan submissions. The policy’s allowance for paper (in principle) means if needed, a paper plan could be submitted, but the preference and eventual requirement will be digital. - This also means legacy cases (partial interests done pre-2005 without subdivisions) will be identified. While grandfathered, they are flagged so that if any further action occurs (transfer or the like), MSLR can require a subdivision at that point. This prevents perpetuation of irregular parcels.
Overall, Policy 1 reinforces that no piece of Settlement land “changes hands” in part unless the community (through its Council) has explicitly agreed to carve out that piece.
Policy 2 – Sending 60-Day Expiry Notice Letters
Date of Original Approval: September 26, 2006    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Under the MSLR Regulation (s.30 and s.73), certain interests – notably Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and some Allotments – have defined expiry dates. For example, a PMT (which is a time-limited title pending conversion to full Métis Title) typically expires after a set term (often 3 years) unless renewed. The law (MSLR Reg s.73(1)(a)(ii)) requires that the Registrar notify the holder that their interest appears to have expired and give them 60 days from the notice to object before cancellation[5]. In practice, MSLR also treats this notice as an opportunity for the holder to renew their interest within that window (even though the regulation specifically frames it around objection to cancellation). Historically, these “60-day notice letters” were sent by registered mail, but a problem arose: many members did not pick up or sign for the registered letters, resulting in them being returned unclaimed. MSLR’s past practice in those cases was often to take no further action – meaning expired interests lingered un-cancelled if the notice couldn’t be confirmed delivered[22][23]. This created legal uncertainty and undermined the enforcement of expiry rules. Alberta legislation (e.g., Interpretation Act and common law) provides that properly addressed mail can be deemed received after a certain period (7 days for regular mail) even without a signature[24]. In 2006, a directive was issued to switch to regular mail to invoke this presumption[25]. Now, with modernization, we also have digital communication channels to augment the notices.
Policy Statement: MSLR will issue expiry notices to interest holders at least 60 days before the interest’s scheduled expiry date. Specifically: - For any PMT or other expiring interest, a notice letter will be prepared 60 days in advance of the expiry. - Delivery method: Notices will be sent via regular mail to the holder’s last known mailing address on file (not registered mail, in order to rely on the presumption of delivery[25]). In addition, if the member has opted into digital communication, the notice will also be delivered through secure electronic means – such as: - Secure Email (to a verified email on record), and/or - MSLR Digital Portal notification (the member will receive an alert in their portal account inbox). - The notice letter will contain: the interest in question, its expiry date, the steps required to renew (e.g., submit a renewal application and pay fees before expiry), any applicable fees, and the consequences of non-renewal (that the interest will be cancelled if not renewed in time). It will also inform the holder of their right to object to the cancellation within 60 days of the notice (per Reg 73) if they believe an error has been made or have another valid ground. - All notices will be dated the same day they are sent (if there is a delay in mailing out a prepared letter, the letter will be re-dated to the actual send date). This ensures the 60-day period is calculated from the date of sending, as required[26]. - Record-keeping: MSLR will keep a log (in the system, automatically) of when each notice was sent (date and method), to track the 60-day countdown for each case.
Implementation: The issuance of 60-day notices will be largely automated: - The MSLR Digital Portal will generate a reminder/workflow for each expiring interest 90 days prior to expiry (to give staff time to verify addresses and prepare notices)[27]. At 60 days prior, it will automatically generate the notice content and prompt dispatch. - Before sending, MSLR staff will ensure the holder’s mailing address is up to date. If there is any concern about the address (e.g., mail returned from previous attempts), staff will confirm the address with the Settlement Council’s records or the Settlement membership administrator, as members are required by MSA (s.76(c)) to maintain a current address with their Settlement[28][29]. - The notice is then sent via regular mail. Simultaneously, for those with digital contact, the system sends the email and posts the portal notification. - A copy of the notice (physical or electronic) will also be sent to the Settlement Land Clerk of the relevant Settlement[30]. This is to facilitate local coordination – often Land Clerks will follow up with members informally to make sure they act on the notice. - If the 60-day period passes with no renewal application or objection, the system will move the interest status to “Expired – pending cancellation” and then to “Cancelled” on the expiry date plus 60 days. The Registrar will formally issue a cancellation entry. (Policy 4 deals with the cancellation process in more detail.) - If the member files an objection within the 60 days (see Policy 3) or a renewal application before expiry, then the interest is not cancelled. A renewal will be processed (Policy 4), and an objection will trigger a suspension of cancellation until resolved (Policy 3).
It’s emphasized that members are responsible for keeping their contact information current. MSLR will use the information on file; if a member fails to receive a notice because they did not update their address or email, that does not exempt them from the expiry and cancellation[31]. This will be clearly stated in the notices and public communications.
Impacts: This policy formalizes a proactive and legally sound approach to handling expiring interests: - Improved Member Awareness: By sending notices through multiple channels (mail and digital), the chance of a member missing the notification is greatly reduced. The inclusion of details on how to renew and the deadline helps members comply and retain their land interests if they so choose. This protects members from inadvertent loss of their land rights simply due to forgetting a date[32]. - Clear Deadlines & Reduced Uncertainty: Dating letters on the mailing date and logging sends means there is no ambiguity about when the 60-day clock starts[26]. Both MSLR and the member can calculate the deadline confidently. This ends the prior hesitation to act on unclaimed notices – now after 7 days of mailing, delivery is presumed[24], and the countdown runs. - Efficiency in Enforcement: With automation, reminders are generated 90 days ahead and tracked. This reduces staff workload in manually monitoring expiries and ensures timely compliance. Once the notice period lapses without response, the system can proceed to cancellation without further delay, clearing expired interests from the registry. This ultimately keeps the registry up-to-date, with fewer stale-dated interests lingering. - Role of Settlement Staff: By copying notices to Settlement offices, local staff can step in to assist members who might be hard to reach (remote, or not checking mail). Many Settlements appreciate being in the loop so they can remind or help elders and others to submit renewals. This fosters a collaborative approach to compliance. - Modernization Alignment: The introduction of digital notifications aligns with broader ARLO trends (Land Titles is doing e-notices too). However, the policy explicitly retains paper mail for those not on email to ensure inclusivity[33]. This dual approach is a model of bridging traditional methods with new technology. - No More Inaction on Unclaimed Notices: Importantly, this policy (together with Policy 3) removes the prior grey area where MSLR would do nothing if a registered letter came back unclaimed[34][25]. Now, failure to sign is moot – regular mail plus the policy that failure to update address is on the member’s shoulders means MSLR will cancel if no response. This ensures that the legal requirement (to cancel expired interests after notice) is carried out, thus clearing titles and allowing land to be reallocated if needed.
Overall, Policy 2 enhances fairness (giving members a clear chance to renew or object) while also ensuring the rules (expiry and cancellation) are actually enforced in a timely manner. It’s a key part of maintaining the integrity of the land registry.
Policy 3 – Objections to Cancellations of Interests
Date of Original Approval: August 26, 2005    Updated: November 22, 2006; July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Members of a Settlement have a statutory right to object to the cancellation of their land interest during that 60-day window after receiving a notice (as described in Policy 2). This right is set out in the MSLR Regulation’s requirement that the Registrar must wait 60 days for any objection before cancelling an interest[6]. Beyond the letter of the law, it is also a matter of procedural fairness – members should have an opportunity to be heard if they believe a cancellation is in error or unjust. In the past, there was no formalized internal process for handling such objections; it was done ad hoc, leading to inconsistencies. Some members who objected late or informally might have been ignored, while others might have had sympathetic consideration. Also, there was confusion whether the member should directly appeal to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) or raise it first with the Registrar. To streamline this, earlier policy guides suggested that MSLR itself refer objections to MSAT immediately upon receipt[35], to avoid delay and simplify the process for the member. This updated policy establishes a clear process: the member submits an objection to MSLR, MSLR pauses cancellation and reviews it, and if unresolved, the matter can go to MSAT, which is the adjudicative body for such disputes (MSA provides for appeals of Registrar decisions to MSAT).
Policy Statement: Members may submit written objections to the cancellation of their land interest within 30 days of receiving a cancellation notice (or, effectively, within 60 days of the notice being sent, since the notice period is 60 days total; the policy uses 30 days from receiving to encourage prompt action). Key points: - The objection must be in writing (including electronic submissions via the portal) and should clearly identify the interest and the grounds of objection. - Valid grounds for objection can include, for example: - Administrative error (e.g., the member did submit a renewal on time but it wasn’t processed, or the expiry date was miscalculated). - Lack of proper notice (e.g., the notice was sent to the wrong address, though with address confirmation steps now, this should be rare). - Payment or action taken that should prevent cancellation (e.g., fees paid or renewal filed but perhaps not linked correctly). - Any other substantial reason that cancellation would be improper under law or policy (for instance, an argument that the interest shouldn’t expire due to some legal exception). - Simply forgetting to renew or not checking mail is not in itself a valid ground – the policy expects something more, but it doesn’t exhaustively list grounds because unusual facts can arise. It does, however, indicate common ones like error or lack of notice[36][37]. - The objection letter/form should include supporting evidence if available (e.g., a receipt of a submitted renewal, or correspondence that shows the member tried to update address, etc.). - Upon receiving a valid objection (timely and from the holder or authorized rep), MSLR will suspend the cancellation of that interest pending review. The interest will not be cancelled while the objection is under consideration. - MSLR will issue a written decision on the objection after review. The decision can be: uphold the objection (do not cancel the interest, perhaps extend time or acknowledge renewal), or deny the objection (proceed with cancellation). - Regardless of the outcome, the member is informed in writing of the decision and the reasons. - If the member is not satisfied with MSLR’s decision, they may appeal to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) as per the avenues available under the MSA. (The MSA allows appeals of Registrar decisions affecting entitlement or rights in land – MSAT has quasi-judicial power to review those.) - MSLR will cooperate by providing MSAT any records or context if an appeal is lodged.
Implementation: - An Objection Form will be made available on the MSLR Digital Portal (and in paper at MSLR office and Settlement offices). This form will guide the member to provide necessary information (name, contact, interest details, reasons, etc.). Members can submit this form electronically through the portal (which will tag it to the relevant interest and notice) or by delivering a paper copy to MSLR. - Timeline: The policy says within 30 days of receiving notice, which essentially translates to roughly within the first half of the 60-day period. In practice, objections will be accepted up until the 60th day after mailing of the notice (since legally that’s the cut-off). However, encouraging 30 days helps MSLR process them in time. MSLR will treat any objection received within the 60-day window as valid. - Upon receipt, the MSLR Registrar (or delegate) will review the objection. This review involves checking: - Was the interest truly expired or was there an error? - Did the member attempt renewal? - Are they raising a point that merits halting cancellation (e.g., they claim no notice – staff can see if notice perhaps went to an old address despite member updates; or a fairness issue like council mishandled a renewal application)? - MSLR aims to complete this review and issue a decision within 15 business days of receiving the objection[38][39]. This prompt timeline ensures that if the objection is denied, the member still has time within the 60-day window to escalate to MSAT before the window closes or concurrent with cancellation. - All statuses are updated in the system: an objection logged will mark the interest as “Objection Pending” so it is not auto-cancelled after 60 days until resolved. - Communication: The member will get updates through the portal on the status of their objection (e.g., “Received – Under Review”, then “Decision issued”). If they submitted on paper, they get a mailed response. - If the decision is to uphold the objection (meaning cancellation will not proceed), MSLR will take corrective action (e.g., if the issue was a late renewal that was actually mailed earlier, maybe accept it; if it was no notice, perhaps re-issue a notice properly, etc.). - If the decision is to cancel anyway (objection denied), MSLR will not cancel until the original 60 days are up, and the decision letter will remind the member of their right to appeal to MSAT. In practice, if an appeal is filed, MSLR would further stay cancellation until MSAT decides. - Audit log: Every objection submission and the outcome will be logged in the system for transparency[40]. This includes the date received, decision date, and who reviewed it.
Additionally, to align with earlier recommendations, MSLR may proactively refer objections to MSAT in certain cases. The updated policy allows MSLR to refer the matter to MSAT if it involves complex judgment on fairness that MSAT is better suited for. For example, if a member’s ground is that the Settlement Council wrongly denied their renewal (a scenario outside MSLR’s authority), MSLR could forward the objection to MSAT for a ruling, rather than just deny it. However, the default approach is to handle straightforward cases in-house and leave appeals to the member’s choice.
Impacts: - Member Rights Upheld: This policy ensures that no member loses an interest without an opportunity to be heard. It formalizes due process in the cancellation procedure, which is critical for fairness and for upholding trust in the registry[41][9]. Knowing they can object will encourage members to come forward with any mitigating information. - Transparency and Trust: The requirement of a written decision with reasons means MSLR is accountable for its actions. Members won’t feel that decisions are arbitrary; they’ll see an explanation (e.g., “Your objection is denied because our records show you applied after the expiry date, which the law does not allow. You may appeal to MSAT if you believe special circumstances apply.”). This transparency can reduce anger or confusion at the community level. - Efficiency in Dispute Resolution: By having a clear channel (first MSLR, then MSAT), it avoids members going straight to political bodies or courts with complaints. It uses the MSAT, which is the specialized tribunal for Settlement issues, to handle contentious cases. Earlier internal deliberations in 2005-2006 identified that quick referral to MSAT is beneficial[35], so this policy endorses that if needed. MSAT’s involvement means an independent body can confirm or overturn MSLR’s decision, which adds credibility to the outcome. - Administrative Pause but No Backlog: While an objection puts cancellation on hold, the number of such objections is expected to be relatively low (most members will simply renew in time if they want to keep the land). Those that do come are handled in a timely manner (15 business days goal), so it shouldn’t create significant backlogs. Audit logs and tracking ensure none fall through the cracks. - Digital Accessibility: The availability of an online form and tracking of objections makes it easier for members to lodge objections. In the past, a member might have had to write a letter or come in person; now they can do it from home. This may slightly increase the number of objections (since it’s easier to file), but that’s acceptable as it means more members exercising their rights. - Appeal Rights Publicized: The policy explicitly mentions MSAT appeals as per MSA. This reminds all parties that MSAT is the ultimate recourse, which might deter frivolous objections (members know a tribunal is involved, so they might only pursue if serious) and conversely ensure legitimate grievances are properly heard.
In essence, Policy 3 balances the need to enforce rules (cancellations when appropriate) with compassion and fairness (allowing a chance to correct errors or injustices). It is a safeguard that complements the strict timeline in Policy 2, preventing any unjust or mistaken loss of land rights.
Policy 4 – Renewal and Cancellation of Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and Allotment Interests
Date of Original Approval: November 22, 2006    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: This policy deals with the life cycle of Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and similar allotment interests which are not permanent unless renewed or converted. Under the MSLR Regulation (sections 30(1)(b), 30(2), and related provisions), a PMT has an expiry date upon which it must be renewed (with required fees) or it will expire[42]. Historically, there were inconsistencies: sometimes late renewals were processed after expiry, or leniency was shown beyond what the regulation allowed, causing confusion about entitlement. To maintain integrity, a stricter adherence to deadlines is necessary – once the term is over without renewal, the interest should end. This policy provides clarity: renew on time or face cancellation, with no exceptions unless an objection is upheld under Policy 3. It also sets procedures for immediate processing of renewals and automatic cancellation on expiry if not renewed.
Policy Statement: The policy is broken into sub-topics for clarity:
•	Renewal Application Timing: MSLR will only accept renewal applications that are submitted before the PMT’s expiry date. Any attempt to renew after the expiry date has passed will be rejected. If a PMT expires on, say, March 31, a renewal must reach MSLR on or before March 31. An application on April 1 is not acceptable; the PMT would be cancelled. This applies similarly to other time-limited allotments (if any have fixed terms).
•	Post-Expiry Applications: Any renewal application or fee payment received after the interest has already expired is invalid. MSLR staff will return such submissions with a notice that the interest has already expired and been cancelled, therefore the renewal cannot be processed. The holder would have to seek a new allotment or title through whatever processes (which likely would require Settlement Council re-approval as a new grant, if at all).
•	Renewal Processing: Any complete renewal application submitted before expiry, with all required information and fees, will be processed immediately upon receipt. MSLR will not delay these; they will extend the PMT’s term or convert it as appropriate (depending on if renewal means extension or if it's meant to trigger full title issuance in some cases). If an application is incomplete (e.g., missing a fee or a signature), it will be handled under Policy 7 – Incomplete Requests, meaning it will be returned as deficient and not processed until corrected[16][43]. The key is that completeness is determined at submission – if incomplete but before expiry, MSLR will notify and there's theoretically still time (if before expiry) for the member to correct and re-submit by the deadline.
•	Cancellation Process: Any PMT or similar interest that is not renewed by the expiry date will be considered expired and will be automatically cancelled on that expiry date (with the formal cancellation action taking effect after the 60-day notice if no objection; effectively at expiry + 60 days). Notice of the cancellation (as per Policy 2) would have been given 60 days prior. If no renewal came, then on day 61 after notice (or shortly thereafter) the Registrar completes the cancellation. A notification of cancellation is sent to the member and the Settlement office for their records[44].
•	For any cancellation due to non-renewal, that land interest reverts to the Settlement (or underlying title holder which is usually the settlement) – meaning the member no longer has rights to it. They could reapply for a new interest via Settlement Council if they desire, but it would be treated as a new request, not a continuation.
These statements essentially enforce a hard deadline culture: no late renewals, no grace periods beyond what the regulation’s 60-day objection already affords.
Implementation: - The Digital Portal will be configured to block any renewal submissions once the expiry date has passed[45]. If a member logs in after expiry, the system will not even allow the form to be submitted, showing a message that the interest has expired and is no longer renewable. - Leading up to expiry, the portal will display to the member (and to staff dashboards) how many days remain and if a renewal is pending or required. - When a renewal application is submitted online, the system will check for completeness (mandatory fields, fee payment attached via online payment). If something is missing, it will prompt the user to complete it. Ideally, the design will not allow submission until all required pieces are there, thereby reducing the incidence of incomplete renewals. - For paper submissions, staff will quickly assess completeness on intake. If something critical is missing and the expiry date is extremely close, staff may attempt to contact the member (especially if it’s just a minor omission) to get it corrected immediately, but are not obligated beyond normal deficiency notice procedure (which might not reach the member in time if they submitted last-minute). Thus, members are encouraged to not wait until the last day. - On the expiry date midnight, if no renewal in system, the interest is flagged expired. A batch job or staff action triggers the cancellation process: generate cancellation entry, send final cancellation confirmation to member (with effective date), update records. - Notifications: The Settlement Land Clerk will be notified of the cancellation of the interest so they can update local records and potentially reallocate the land or note it’s available (depending on Settlement process). - Portal Dashboard: The member’s view after cancellation will show the interest as cancelled/closed. If they attempt to renew after that, the system might direct them to contact their Settlement about new applications (but not allow renewal). - Staff are trained that no discretionary exceptions should be made. Even if a member pleads they were one day late, staff must uniformly apply the rule (unless of course an objection with cause is filed and upheld by Registrar or MSAT, as per Policy 3).
Impacts: - Strict Compliance: This policy ensures the MSLR enforces the statutory timelines strictly, eliminating any past leniency that could be seen as unequal treatment. Everyone gets the same rule: renew by expiry or lose the interest. This brings clarity and finality to the status of PMTs – no more ambiguous extensions or files lingering in limbo. - Member Responsibility: It places clear responsibility on members to act in time. With the help of Policy 2 (notices 60 days prior) and portal reminders, members are well-warned. Those who value their land interest will take action. Those who do not or cannot (and don’t object) will lose the interest, potentially allowing others in need to apply for that land. While harsh to latecomers, it upholds fairness in the sense that rules are rules and others may be waiting for that land. - Administrative Efficiency: From MSLR’s perspective, this eliminates having to judge “late excuses” and similar case-by-case mercy decisions. It streamlines processing – on-time renewals are processed immediately, late ones are automatically out. This also helps in planning resource-wise: a surge of renewals will happen before deadlines, which can be anticipated and managed (maybe more staff around typical expiry cycles), instead of dribbling in unpredictably after the fact. - Alignment with ARLO Principles: In Land Titles, deadlines (like caveat renewals, etc.) are also strict. Aligning MSLR with such stringent practice is professionally sound and lends credibility. The automation part aligns with ARLO’s efficiency focus by reducing manual oversight needs[46]. - Member Education Needed: There is an impact that members must be educated on this “no late renewal” rule. Historically, if some were allowed to sneak in a late renewal, they will need to be re-educated that this is no longer possible. Settlement councils and MSLR will need to communicate this change clearly during the rollout of the new system to avoid any shock. - Risk Mitigation: The risk of an unjust cancellation is mitigated by Policy 3 (objection process). If someone truly has a compelling reason (e.g., Council failed to act on their timely renewal request or personal emergency), they can object and possibly get relief. So the system isn’t without recourse, but it’s initiated by the member to claim their circumstance. - Clarity on PMT Status: This results in a clearer land registry. A PMT is either active or, if expired and not renewed, promptly cancelled. The Settlements will know which lands have reverted and can plan accordingly. It prevents scenarios of people squatting on expired titles or confusion if an expired interest is still showing as active because someone allowed a late renewal.
In short, Policy 4 establishes a culture of timely compliance and ensures that renewal obligations are taken seriously by all parties, thus protecting the Settlements from protracted pending statuses and ensuring land availability is up-to-date.
Policy 5 – Termination of Membership and Termination of Land Interests
Date of Original Approval: February 16, 2005    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Under the Metis Settlements framework, only Settlement members can hold Settlement land interests (Metis Title, PMT, etc.). Therefore, when a person’s membership is terminated (for instance, if they voluntarily withdraw, are removed under disciplinary provisions, or pass away without eligible heirs to take membership), their land interests should cease as well. The MSA and MSLR Reg reflect this linkage (MSA s.95 and MSLR Reg s.30(1)(j) provide that when membership is terminated, land interests are terminated/cancelled by operation of law). However, in practice, some membership terminations were not promptly followed by land interest cancellations – often due to incomplete documentation or pending legal considerations. For example, in a case like Vicklund vs. Peavine Settlement (a well-known legal case), issues of fairness and potential trust arrangements for family members arose, causing hesitation in immediate cancellation. Over the years, a backlog of “membership termination files on hold” accumulated, where MSLR didn’t cancel the land interests because something was unresolved (maybe the person had appealed their termination, or the council hadn’t sent an official notice, etc.). This policy is needed to streamline the approach: to promptly process clear-cut membership terminations and to have a method for clearing old cases that were left in limbo, while still respecting exceptions (e.g., court orders or fairness principles that might dictate a different outcome in specific cases).
Policy Statements:
•	Existing Terminations on Hold: For membership termination cases that are currently held in abeyance at MSLR due to incomplete information or conditional factors, MSLR will take action to clear these files. Specifically:
•	If a termination file (from past years) is incomplete or conditional – for example, missing a council resolution, or subject to a pending appeal or awaiting member instructions – MSLR will return the file to the sender (often the Settlement or MSGC office that initiated it) with a request to complete the necessary documentation. A copy of this correspondence will also be sent to the affected member (if reachable) to inform them of the status and what is needed[47][48].
•	Essentially, MSLR is saying: “We cannot keep this pending indefinitely. Here’s what is missing; please resubmit when you have everything.” This shifts the onus back to whoever initiated the termination to resolve any conditions (for example, if it was waiting for a particular legal decision, they should provide it, or if it needed the member’s instruction for land disposition, they must get it).
•	Once such a file is resubmitted with all required elements and any conditions resolved, MSLR will process it immediately (i.e., proceed to cancel the land interest and update the registry accordingly)[48].
•	The goal is to eliminate the backlog by either completing each termination properly or sending it back to be sorted out rather than sitting in MSLR’s queue indefinitely.
•	Future Terminations: Going forward, any membership termination (e.g., a member is formally removed or voluntarily resigns) will be processed as soon as the documentation is received, provided it is complete and meets legal requirements.
•	“Complete documentation” includes proof of the membership termination (could be an MSGC membership authority letter or Settlement council’s motion, depending on how membership is administered), and any required notices or evidence that due process was followed for the termination.
•	If those are in order, MSLR will promptly cancel that individual’s land interests per the law (cancelling or transferring them as appropriate).
•	The policy also states: Membership termination automatically triggers land interest termination, except where exceptions apply[49][50]. That is a reaffirmation of what the law dictates – if you are not a member, you cannot hold the land, so it must be relinquished. However, it acknowledges exceptions such as:
o	Fairness principles or court orders: For instance, if a court directs that the land interest not be cancelled immediately due to an ongoing appeal or that it be held in trust for a period.
o	Specific member instructions: Perhaps a member losing membership gave instructions for how their land should be dealt with (maybe transfer to a family member who is a member, etc.) in anticipation. If those align with the law and policy, MSLR can respect them (e.g., converting to someone else’s name if that’s legally allowed).
o	The mention of Vicklund vs. Peavine likely refers to a case where a member’s membership was terminated but a court ruled the land couldn’t be seized immediately due to some fairness argument. So MSLR would heed such precedents and handle those scenarios carefully (likely by not cancelling until certain conditions are met).
So the two statements cover clearing past backlog and handling new cases swiftly.
Implementation: - A review of all pending membership termination files will be conducted. MSLR staff will compile a list of cases where a member’s status changed but their land interests are still in that member’s name on the registry. - For each case: - If straightforward (e.g., member passed away with no successors and Settlement asked for cancellation but maybe some minor doc missing), reach out to Settlement/initiator to get missing info. - If complicated (e.g., ongoing appeal with MSAT or court), flag the conditions and follow up with MSGC legal or appropriate body to understand when it will resolve. - Then take action as per policy: return incomplete ones with letters outlining what’s needed. - Develop a standard template letter for returning incomplete termination files, including checklist of missing items. - When those come back complete, treat them as priority to finalize. Likely, finalizing means updating the land registry to show the interest is cancelled (and perhaps marked as “Available” or transferred to Settlement). - For new membership terminations: - Ensure communication channels with MSGC membership clerk or Settlement membership committees are strong, so that whenever a membership is revoked or surrendered, MSLR is promptly notified with required documents. - Train MSLR staff to immediately link any membership termination notice to the member’s land interests and initiate cancellation workflow. - The Digital Portal might have an internal module for membership status; possibly direct integration with the Central Members List to automatically flag when someone is removed. If feasible, an automated trigger could notify MSLR staff of membership changes. - However, given sensitivity, likely a manual confirmation is used: once notified, the Registrar double-checks that termination is valid (e.g., properly approved under MSA provisions) then authorizes land interest cancellations. - For exceptions: - Develop guidelines on what qualifies. E.g., if there is a pending appeal of the membership termination, obviously hold off until that is resolved (don’t cancel prematurely). If MSAT or a court issues a stay on cancellation, obey that. - If the member gave instruction for land (some older policies or law allow a member whose membership is ending to sell or transfer their land to another member, perhaps under supervision), ensure those are considered. Possibly involve Settlement council to approve any transfer if needed. - If unclear, consult with the department’s legal advisors or MSGC to avoid wrongful cancellation. - Send notifications when a termination is processed: - Notify the (former) member via mail (if address known) or their representative that their land interests are now cancelled due to membership termination (and if any procedure to reclaim if they regain membership – though usually not). - Notify the Settlement council so they know the land can be reallocated or is under Settlement control now. - The digital system can mark those interests as cancelled with reason “membership terminated”.
Impacts: - Reduced Backlog: By returning incomplete files, MSLR effectively says “we’re not holding these open any longer.” This prevents indefinite limbo where land could not be reallocated. Some older cases might resolve quickly once attention is drawn; others might simply never come back (if, say, a member left 15 years ago and nobody cares now, the Settlement might just drop it). Either way, MSLR’s pending list clears. - Immediate Processing Going Forward: Future terminations being immediate means the registry stays current. The moment someone is no longer a member, their land doesn’t sit with them on title – it’s updated, which prevents any unauthorized dealing by that person and clarifies ownership. - Consistency with Law: This enforces MSA s.95 properly – no member retains land after losing membership. It also addresses a past criticism that MSLR was slow or uneven in applying that rule. - Automation Link: The Digital Portal can link membership and land records so that termination triggers cancellations in a largely automated way (with manual oversight). This is an example of aligning with ARLO principle of connected data – though in Land Titles such a scenario doesn’t occur (no membership concept), here it’s special but we use tech to handle it[51][52]. - Member Awareness: Members will be aware that if they leave or are removed from membership, they cannot expect to keep land or delay its return. This could have social implications – e.g., it could incentivize someone facing termination to transfer their land to another member before the termination is finalized, if allowed. Settlement Councils may need to manage that carefully to avoid last-minute dubious transfers. However, that’s a governance issue beyond MSLR’s scope. MSLR just enforces the outcome. - Exceptions and Fairness: By acknowledging exceptions (like Vicklund case), the policy is not blindly bureaucratic; it shows willingness to accommodate unique scenarios where immediate cancellation would be unfair. In Vicklund, for instance, an individual’s membership was terminated but the court allowed him to retain some rights to land for a period due to equity considerations. MSLR will respect such outcomes, thereby avoiding legal disputes and showing cultural sensitivity to not create undue hardship where a precedent says otherwise. This also means close collaboration with MSGC and legal counsel to know when to carve out exceptions. - Communication/Coordination: There’s an added workload in coordinating with membership authorities to ensure terminations come with proper docs. But this is offset by clarity – everyone knows MSLR won’t proceed without a complete package. So likely MSGC’s membership office will improve their process to always include needed info when sending terminations to MSLR.
By implementing Policy 5, the registry will maintain an accurate reflection of who is entitled to hold land at any given time, and will eliminate a historical source of confusion and delay. It underscores the principle that Settlement land is for Settlement members only, administratively enforcing that promptly while still allowing case-by-case fairness as needed.
Policy 6 – Accessing the Settlement Members List
Date of Original Approval: March 10, 2005    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: The Settlement Members List is the official roster of members eligible to hold land interests on each Metis Settlement. Under MSA section 98, access to this Members List is restricted – only authorized persons may inspect it, because it contains personal information and sensitive status data. In the past, the list was maintained in paper or simple database form and only accessible at certain offices. However, there were instances where unauthorized individuals sought to access the list or where confusion existed about who exactly is “authorized.” Operationally, MSLR staff use the Members List to verify membership status for land transactions, and Settlement or MSGC staff maintain and use it for governance. Privacy legislation (FOIP) also applies, meaning personal data on it must be protected. This policy delineates who can access the Members List and under what conditions, ensuring member privacy is protected while allowing those who need the information to get it.
Policy Statement: Access to the Settlement Members List is strictly limited to the following categories of individuals, who are considered “authorized persons” for the purposes of MSA s.98 and privacy requirements: - Settlement Council members (elected councillors of the respective Settlement) and their authorized staff who require the list to perform official duties (for example, verifying membership for local decisions). - MSGC members (the elected representatives on the Metis Settlements General Council) and MSGC authorized staff, since MSGC has oversight on membership policy and might need to cross-reference membership in policy enforcement. - Government officials with a regulatory or administrative need – typically this means officials from the Ministry (e.g., Indigenous Relations) or MSLR staff themselves, who need the list for fulfilling duties like verifying if an applicant is a member. - Legal representatives with member authorization – e.g., if a lawyer or agent is acting on behalf of a member and needs to confirm their client’s membership status for a land dealing, they can be given confirmation or access, provided the member has consented in writing. - Individual members accessing their own information – a Settlement member has the right to see their own entry on the list (and perhaps limited info about general membership counts, etc., but not others’ personal details without authorization).
Any access request must specify the purpose and scope of information needed, and it must align with both the MSA requirements and privacy laws. For instance, a councilor might request the list to check eligible voters for a land allocation meeting – that’s legitimate. But a person cannot access it out of curiosity or for unrelated purposes.
Some specific clarifications: - The Members List may include data like member’s full name, membership number, status (active, on appeal, etc.), and current mailing address (since maintaining address is a requirement). This policy treats that data as confidential. - If someone requests access who is not on the above list (e.g., a researcher or a company), MSLR will deny it unless they obtain explicit General Council and individual consents, etc., which is outside normal practice. - Even those authorized should only access it for official purposes. For example, a council member can’t take the list and share it publicly; doing so would violate privacy rules.
Implementation: - The MSLR Digital Portal (administrative side) will implement role-based access controls that mirror these rules[53]. For example: - Only users with certain roles (MSLR staff, Settlement Administrator role, MSGC admin role) can pull up the full Members List or search it. - Council members might have a portal login that allows them to query membership status for individuals from their settlement, but not necessarily download the entire list (unless needed). - Government back-end users can see it as needed. - Multi-factor authentication and user identity verification will be required for anyone accessing membership data, given its sensitivity[53][54]. - A request process remains for external authorized requests: e.g., if an outside lawyer with consent needs to confirm membership, they likely won’t have direct portal access. Instead, they would submit a request form to MSLR (or Settlement office) with proof of client authorization. MSLR staff would then provide a confirmation letter “Yes, Person X is a member of Settlement Y as of today” rather than giving them the whole list. - Logging: All access to the Members List is logged (who accessed, when, and if possible, what they viewed)[53]. The system will keep audit logs to detect any unauthorized or excessive access. For instance, if a clerk’s account is suddenly pulling the entire list without reason, that could be flagged. - Settlement Land & Membership staff who process manual requests must verify the person’s identity and authorization before showing any info. E.g., if a member walks in asking to see if their cousin is a member – that’s not allowed, unless the cousin authorized it. - MSLR will remind all parties, via training and perhaps a disclaimer on the data access screen, that misuse of the list (viewing or sharing information beyond what’s needed) is a breach of policy and possibly legislation.
Impacts: - Privacy Protection: By clearly limiting who can access membership information, this policy helps protect members’ personal data. This fosters trust in the system – members can be assured that their info (like addresses) isn’t freely available to anyone and won’t be misused. It’s consistent with FOIP and MSA’s privacy intents[55]. - Operational Needs Met: At the same time, those who genuinely need the information (councils, MSGC, MSLR) have access, ensuring that operations aren’t hindered. For example, MSLR can confidently give Settlement councilors access to check membership before approving a land transfer (they might want to ensure the transferee is a member). Government oversight bodies can monitor membership numbers and statuses for policy reasons. - Digital Security: Implementing role-based access with multi-factor authentication ensures that even if login credentials were stolen, it’s hard to breach[53]. The audit logs further deter any user with access from snooping without cause, since it could be traced back[55]. - Clear Guidelines: By enumerating categories, the policy removes ambiguity. Previously, staff might be unsure – “can I show the list to this person?” Now they have a checklist: Is the person a council member? Yes, proceed for official use. If not, sorry. This consistency prevents nepotism or favoritism in granting access. - Member Self-Service: By allowing members to see their own info, it encourages them to keep their information up to date (address, etc., as required by MSA). They could log in and update or at least see if it’s correct. This ties in with Policy 2 noticing – if addresses are current, notices reach them. - Compliance with Modern Privacy Expectations: The principle aligns with Alberta’s modernization in other systems – for instance, access to motor vehicle registries is also restricted to authorized agents. So it brings MSLR up to standard in handling personal info.
In conclusion, Policy 6 ensures that while the MSLR and Settlement institutions have the data needed for governance, the sensitive information in the Members List is guarded against improper disclosure. It balances openness and confidentiality, which is crucial in a small community context to prevent misuse of personal details.
Policy 7 – Incomplete Requests to MSLR
Date of Original Approval: October 1, 2009    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: In the past, MSLR often received incomplete or deficient applications for land transactions – missing signatures, absent required documents (like a survey plan or Council approval), or even wrong information (like a wrong land description). Historically, there was a tendency to hold these submissions in pending files and engage in back-and-forth communications to get them completed. This led to significant administrative burden, clutter (files piling up), and sometimes disputes about processing order or timelines (with some accusing the registry of delay when in fact the file was incomplete). A policy decision was made around 2009 that MSLR should not accept incomplete submissions at all – i.e., if something is missing, don’t lodge it in pending; just reject and return it immediately with an explanation. This ensures fairness (everyone is held to the same standard) and efficiency (MSLR works on complete files only). With modernization, the digital portal can assist by screening for completeness upfront. This updated policy reinforces that stance and integrates digital enhancements.
Policy Statement: MSLR will not accept or process any land or membership transaction request that is deemed incomplete upon submission. Incomplete means not meeting the MSLR’s published standards of a proper submission. Key points: - If a submission (application) lacks required documentation or information – for example: missing a legal land description, missing proof of membership class (for certain grants), missing a required prior approval like Settlement Council resolution for a transfer, or even missing signatures – then MSLR will immediately reject and return that submission. - The submitter (and relevant Settlement office if they forwarded it) will get a deficiency notice in writing. This notice will outline specifically what is missing or deficient that caused the rejection[56][57]. For example: “Your application to register a land transfer is missing the transferee’s signature and the required council approval document. Therefore, it cannot be processed.” - No partial processing or “holding on file” will occur; the file is closed until resubmitted properly. - This policy applies to all types of transactions – land interest registrations, transfers, cancellations initiated by councils, membership list updates, etc. If an item is not in order, it is not accepted.
Consistency is emphasized: all parties are treated equally – whether it’s a member, a council submission, or a government request, if it’s incomplete, it’s rejected. This avoids perceptions of favoritism or bending rules for some.
Implementation: - Standards Definition: MSLR will publish checklists and guidelines for what constitutes a complete submission for each type of transaction (e.g., to register a transfer: need Form X completed, signed by all parties, membership numbers, proof of payment of fees, council approval if needed, etc.). - Training Staff: All intake staff (or digital intake algorithms) are trained/configured to scrutinize incoming submissions. If any required element is missing, they are to halt processing. - Deficiency Notices: A template for deficiency notices is maintained, where staff can tick or fill in the missing items. This notice is then sent via: - Registered mail or regular mail to the applicant (depending on what contact info provided), and - Digital portal notification or email if available (for quicker communication). - Additionally, a copy to Settlement Land & Membership staff (especially if they originally forwarded it or if the matter concerns a Settlement, since they might help the member fix the application)[58][59]. - MSLR logs the rejection in its system for reference – this could be important if, say, a member corrects and resubmits; staff know it’s a re-submission from a prior deficiency. - Portal Validation: On the Digital Portal, many incomplete submissions will be prevented automatically: - Required fields cannot be left blank. - If an uploaded document is required (like a subdivision plan for partial interest, or council resolution for a transfer exceeding certain acreage), the system will prompt and not allow final submission until attached[60]. - The portal can do real-time checks such as: is the person’s membership valid? Is the land description matching an existing parcel? If those fail, user is alerted. - In this way, many deficiencies are caught by the user themselves online and corrected before submission. - For offline submissions (paper), staff will do a quick completeness check at the counter. Actually, Policy 15 later also says MSLR staff won’t fill out forms for you, but they might still check and say “this is missing X, I can’t take it.” Ideally, they’ll identify and tell the person to complete it rather than formally take it in and then issue a notice. - After the effective date (which was Oct 1, 2009 originally for the no-incomplete rule and updated with portal in 2025), no file is kept open for incomplete ones. This frees up space and mental load. - A note: The policy says it was effective for all transactions as of 2009, with digital enhancements added in 2025[61]. So the concept isn’t new; the new part is the portal’s immediate feedback akin to Land Titles’ “PRQ deficiency correction process” (Professional Request Queue) where submissions can be corrected quickly online[60].
Impacts: - Efficiency Gains: Eliminating incomplete files means MSLR staff focus only on actionable requests. It removes the former “holding bin” of pending cases, which often clogged the system. This will streamline operations dramatically[62]. - Predictability: Applicants know where they stand – if they got a deficiency notice, they know it’s on them to fix and reapply, rather than wondering if MSLR is doing something. And when they do resubmit, it’s treated as a new submission (though MSLR might expedite it since it was just a small fix, but that’s a courtesy, not an obligation). - Fairness and Standardization: Everyone faces the same requirement and quick rejection if not complete. Over time, this will educate the user base to “do it right the first time.” Settlement offices likely will improve their pre-screening of members’ applications to avoid embarrassment of rejections, thus raising the quality of submissions overall. - Reduction of Processing Delays: Many delays historically were due to back-and-forth on incomplete files. Now, by cutting that out, the overall turnaround for complete files improves. If 100% complete files come in, they can be processed nearly immediately. The portal’s real-time validation further reduces delays because the correction can be instantaneous when the user is filling the form (like an error message “upload missing document” and then they do it right away, rather than sending it, waiting a week for mail, etc.). - Accessibility Consideration: Multi-channel deficiency communication (mail and portal) ensures even those offline get informed, but those online can fix faster[60]. This hybrid approach addresses accessibility – no one is left not knowing why nothing happened. - Record-keeping: A side benefit is MSLR can use deficiency logs to identify common problems (if a certain requirement is often missed, maybe instructions need improvement or the requirement reconsidered). They can then adjust guidance or the portal to address those. - Strict but Supportive: While the policy is strict (zero tolerance for incomplete), the modernization has a supportive element: the portal’s immediate feedback is effectively coaching the user to completeness[60]. Also, the help resources likely include samples and checklists. So the approach is “we won’t process incomplete stuff, but we’ll do our best to help you not submit incomplete stuff in the first place.”
In sum, Policy 7 ensures that MSLR operates on a “complete documents only” basis, which is a hallmark of an efficient registry (mirroring Land Titles Office practice as well). It pushes diligence onto applicants and improves overall throughput and fairness.
Policy 8 – Digital Maps and Plans
Date of Original Approval: June 15, 2010    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Accurate mapping of land parcels is critical for any land registry. Traditionally, the MSLR maintained spatial data (parcel boundaries, plans) in separate AutoCAD files or paper plan files that weren’t integrated with the registry database. This made it difficult to validate legal descriptions or ensure that a described parcel actually matches a surveyed location. The Alberta Land Titles Office moved towards digital plan submission and an integrated digital cadastre (now the ARLO parcel map). For MSLR, modernization requires similar integration so that Settlement land plans are part of a digital mapping system, improving accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, many Settlement lands remain unsurveyed or partially surveyed, and historically paper maps were used. This policy encourages and eventually mandates use of digital survey plans and integration with mapping standards, while managing the transition.
Policy Statement: MSLR will henceforth accept digital survey plans in approved electronic formats and strongly prefer them over paper. Key points: - Digital plans must be in formats that meet MSLR and Alberta Survey Standards – e.g., CAD (Computer-Aided Design) files like DWG/DXF, or LandXML, etc., as long as they preserve the survey accuracy and can be geo-referenced. - Every plan must be signed and sealed by a licensed Alberta Land Surveyor (ALS), as required by the Surveys Act and MSA, to be legally valid[63][64]. The digital submission must include a verifiable digital signature or a signed verification sheet. - Plans should tie into the Alberta Township System (ATS) coordinates or UTM coordinates to situate the parcel correctly on the earth’s surface[64]. This is crucial for integration with the ARLO parcel fabric – basically, the plan’s coordinates allow it to drop into the provincial map seamlessly. - The policy acknowledges that paper plans are still accepted during a transitional period, particularly if a surveyor or Settlement is not yet up to digital submission, but it notes that digital submission is preferred for long-term efficiency[65]. Over time, the aim is to have all plans digital. - In addition to new plans, existing AutoCAD files and legacy maps will be converted or imported into the new system to create a complete digital map of Settlement lands.
Implementation: - Digital Portal Integration: The MSLR Portal will have a module for plan submission. When a land surveyor or Settlement clerk submits a plan (e.g., after a subdivision or new survey), they will upload the CAD file and any supporting documents. The portal will perform checks: - Format check – is it .dwg, .dxf, LandXML, etc., and readable? - Does it contain a Surveyor’s digital signature or seal? (If not, perhaps require an attached PDF of the signed surveyor affidavit). - Basic geo-check – does it have coordinate references that align with ATS or known points? - The system will leverage the ARLO parcel fabric as a reference[66][64]. Possibly via a web service to verify that the new plan’s coordinates don’t overlap incorrectly or that they fall within the Settlement boundary, etc. - Licensing validation: Integration with the Alberta Land Surveyors’ Association database or government database to ensure the submitting surveyor is currently licensed. (ARLO has something similar, as mentioned in principle, and MSLR will mirror that)[67]. - Once submitted, the plan’s data (boundaries, parcel ID, etc.) will be stored in MSLR’s GIS module linked to the registry database[67][68]. So for each title or interest, one can retrieve its spatial representation from the GIS. - Backup: During the transition, MSLR will still keep paper copies or at least digital image backups (PDFs) of plans as official records[67][69]. This is to ensure there’s a tangible reference and to mitigate any tech issues. But the authoritative reference for location will shift to the digital map once confidence is built. - Staff training: MSLR staff need training in using GIS tools to examine plans, overlay them, etc. Settlement Land clerks also may need orientation on digital plan requirements so they can liaise with surveyors. - Possibly, a pilot with one or two Settlements might have been done to iron out kinks (maybe in 2024). Now full rollout is in this policy.
Impacts: - Accuracy: Digital plans greatly improve spatial accuracy. Coordinates mean that if two parcels should adjoin, their plans will match up in the GIS (no gaps/overlaps if done right). This reduces future disputes over boundaries, which is critical for community harmony and legal clarity. - Efficiency: Processing digital plans is faster – no need to manually digitize a paper plan. The portal can integrate it and even auto-populate land descriptions or area calculations. Searching for plans becomes easier (search by area, etc., on the map rather than rifling through files). Also, linking with ARLO ensures compatibility if any Settlement land ever intersects or relates to provincial land surveys. - Storage and Preservation: Relying on digital reduces physical storage needs (no large plan drawers to maintain for new plans). The risk of losing or damaging a paper plan is gone once digitized. However, proper backup (as policy ensures with replication to a second data center) protects against digital loss as well. - Legacy Issues: There will be an initial workload to integrate old AutoCAD files into the new GIS. But once done, it addresses the legacy integration issues noted in risk assessments[67][70]. The result is one unified map system. - User Benefit: Members and Settlement officials could eventually see an interactive map of Settlement lands via the portal (perhaps read-only to general members) to identify parcels, which increases transparency of land holdings and could help in planning. - Training and Transition Cost: On the flip side, not all surveyors or clerks are immediately comfortable with digital submissions. The policy notes training is required[71]. There might be some resistance or initial errors (like format issues) to overcome. The transitional acceptance of paper ensures those who absolutely can’t do digital yet aren’t barred – but presumably they are fewer over time as industry standard is now digital anyway. - Consistency with Provincial Systems: Aligning with ARLO means that, for instance, if in the future any Métis Settlement land or interest needs to be cross-referenced or even converted to fee simple (unlikely scenario, but if any cooperative projects occur), the data will be consistent. It essentially modernizes the Metis Settlements mapping to be on par with Alberta Land Titles mapping[63][66]. - Risk Reduction: The policy addresses a risk identified in ERM about data corruption – by having replication and robust digital measures, the chances of catastrophic loss of spatial data are minimized[67].
In short, Policy 8 drives the MSLR into the era of digital cadastre, which is foundational for a modern registry. It capitalizes on technology for better accuracy and sets the stage for more advanced capabilities (like one day online map-based applications, etc.). It acknowledges the need for a transition but clearly signals the direction: digital is the default.
Policy 9 – Estate Instructions
Date of Original Approval: April 19, 2006    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Estate instructions refer to the documented wishes of a Settlement member regarding the transfer of their land interests upon their death. Under the MSA and MSGC Land Policy (notably section 7.8 of the Land Policy), Settlement members can designate who should inherit their land interest, subject to rules (the inheritor usually must be an eligible member, etc.). Managing estate transfers has been sensitive: it involves privacy (the instructions are confidential until death) and conflict resolution (potential disputes between family members). In the past, some estate instructions were simply filed as sealed envelopes or documents with MSLR or Settlement offices, without a clear process for how they are stored or accessed. There have been cases of disputes if multiple instructions were left or if a member did transactions contradicting an earlier will. This policy sets rules for handling estate instructions to ensure they are legally compliant (e.g., consistent with MSA and Land Policy), securely stored, and properly executed when the time comes.
Policy Statements: - Whole Interest Transfers Only: Estate instructions must transfer the entire interest to a single individual (or entity if allowed, but likely only individuals who are members qualify). Partial splits of one land interest among multiple beneficiaries are not accepted[72][73]. Rationale: the Land Policy or best practice likely requires one interest = one heir, to avoid fractional interests or co-ownership that can complicate matters. If a member wants to benefit multiple people, they might need to subdivide or otherwise plan in life. - Conflict with Pre-Death Transactions: If a member does a land transaction while alive that conflicts with previously filed estate instructions, the lifetime transaction prevails (once registered). Unregistered deals (e.g., they promised land in a contract but never registered) do not override a valid estate instruction. But basically, if by the time of death the member had already transferred the land or part of it, the estate instruction can only apply to what remains. So the policy says: any unregistered transactions claimed after death (like someone says “he sold me this in principle but didn’t register”) will not override a proper estate instruction on file[74][75]. This is to honor formal filings over informal claims and reduce disputes. - Multiple Instructions: If multiple estate instructions are found for the same person, the policy is the most recent properly executed one will prevail[75][76]. “Properly executed” likely means signed, dated, witnessed as required. This encourages members to update instructions as needed, knowing the latest will count (similar to how wills work in general). - Confidentiality: Estate instructions on file are to remain confidential and can only be disclosed to authorized persons after the member’s death[77][78]. Authorized persons might include: the executor of the estate, the beneficiary named, Settlement or MSGC officials as needed to implement, or a court if relevant. While the member is alive, no one should snoop or even confirm details of their instruction, except the member themselves can of course review or replace it.
These statements ensure clarity in how estate documents are treated, to avoid legal challenges or confusion at a sensitive time (someone’s passing).
Implementation: - Secure Digital Vault: The MSLR Digital Portal will include a feature (for MSLR internal use mostly) to store estate instruction documents in a secure digital vault[79]. Each member who submits an estate instruction will have it scanned (if it’s on paper) or uploaded. - This vault will have access restricted such that it’s not viewable by regular registry staff or anyone until a certain trigger (the member’s death) occurs. - Probably a small number of senior staff or the Registrar can access it under specific protocol. - Filing Process: Members can file estate instructions by submitting them (in sealed envelope or digitally) to MSLR or through Settlement offices. MSLR logs that an instruction is on file (maybe a flag in the member’s data: “Estate instruction filed: Yes, date.”). But content is not revealed. - Activation: When a member dies (notification might come via Settlement Council or family), the MSLR will verify death (likely require a death certificate or official notice from Settlement membership administrator). Then: - MSLR retrieves the estate instruction from the vault. - The content is shared with those who need to implement it: likely the Settlement Council (which usually issues Métis Title to the beneficiary if eligible) and the named beneficiary. - If the estate instruction says transfer to Person X, and Person X is an existing member, then the Settlement Council and MSLR work to issue a new title to X accordingly (perhaps via the normal application but expedited). - If there is any conflict check needed – e.g., the instruction says give land to John, but the decedent already transferred half to Jane last year – then per policy, only what’s left can go to John. MSLR’s automated checks may flag that there’s something to reconcile[80]. - Automated Conflict Checks: MSLR’s system will, upon activating an estate instruction, flag any discrepancies[80]: - It will compare the land interests listed in the instruction vs what the member actually had at death. - If an interest mentioned doesn’t exist or has changed, it flags staff to review and perhaps consult the Settlement or MSAT if needed. - Settlement Councils will be notified when an estate instruction is “activated” (i.e., a member on their settlement died and had an instruction)[81]. They often will have to approve the formal transfer to the heir as per local process (though usually they honor it as a right). - Storage & Access: The digital vault ensures that only authorized retrieval occurs. Probably multi-key access (two people needed to open or log reasons). - Process for multiple instructions: If a member files a new instruction, it should supersede the old. Implementation might involve marking the older one as superseded (but keeping it archived). The system could enforce only one “active” instruction at a time per member. If they submit a second, staff link it and note the date. - Members can also withdraw an instruction (maybe they decide to let intestacy rules apply or to handle via will in another way). They can request MSLR to remove or destroy it; if law allows, MSLR will comply or mark none on file. - If no estate instruction is on file, presumably the land interest goes by intestate succession rules in MSA (likely to spouse or children who are members, or to Settlement if none – but this is outside MSLR’s direct policy, though MSLR would follow whatever legal direction is given by estate executors or MSAT in that case).
Impacts: - Orderly Succession: This policy ensures that when a member dies, there is an orderly process to transfer their land according to their wishes (if stated) and law. It helps prevent disputes among relatives because a clear instruction is on file that MSLR will honor (assuming it meets criteria). If multiple family members thought they had claim, but the latest instruction says only one, that stands – others might appeal to MSAT, but at least MSLR has a stance. - Protects Member Autonomy: By allowing members to designate who inherits, it aligns with MSGC Land Policy that promotes keeping land in family or community with minimal conflict. It also ensures those instructions are kept secret (so members can do this without pressure from others who might want to know)[78], which encourages more to actually use this tool, knowing confidentiality is respected. - Digital Security: Storing these in a secure module prevents what used to be physical risks (lost paper, someone tampering with envelopes). It also logs who accesses them and when, which can be shown if ever needed (e.g., if someone alleges an instruction was altered, the logs can show chain of custody). - Reduced Litigation: Clear rules on multiple instructions and conflicting actions reduce ambiguity. For example, if a member gave two different instructions at different times, only the last counts – the earlier one can’t be brought by someone as a claim. If someone says “but he promised me this land,” if it wasn’t in a formal instruction or registered, it won’t override what is formally on file[75]. This gives weight to the official process and might deter extralegal arrangements. - Council Oversight: Settlement Councils being notified ensures local leadership knows when land is about to change hands due to death. They might need to confirm the beneficiary meets eligibility or maybe approve membership for them if not a member (if policies allow certain family to join to inherit). This fosters coordination between MSLR and local governance at a crucial time. - Privacy Concerns: The emphasis on confidentiality means even within MSLR, not everyone can peek at estate instructions. This protects sensitive wishes from gossip or misuse (for example, if someone designated a non-family member, that could be controversial; confidentiality avoids issues until it’s necessary to reveal). - Member Trust: Knowing their instructions will be kept safe and used appropriately might encourage more members to formalize their estate plans, leading to less land ending up in limbo when someone dies. This ultimately helps keep land in active use and properly titled to the next holder, rather than stuck in probate or unclear status.
Policy 9 thus creates a robust framework for handling inheritance of Settlement land that respects both the laws and the personal wishes of members, in a secure and efficient manner.
Policy 10 – Limits on Member Land Holdings
Date of Original Approval: August 30, 2006    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: The MSGC Land Policy imposes acreage limits on how much land a single member can hold in Métis Title, aiming to ensure equitable distribution. As noted earlier, the typical rule has been ~175 acres plus one additional parcel (167 acres) under certain conditions (total ~342 acres). However, the authority of MSLR (via legislation) to enforce these limits depends on interest type: - For Métis Title (the final patent-like title), the Land Policy can be directly applied (since MSGC must approve new titles anyway and can deny if over cap). - For Provisional Métis Title (PMT) or Allotment transactions, the regulatory framework did not explicitly give the Registrar power to refuse registration if it causes the member to exceed the cap. Section 29(1)(g) of the MSLR Regulation might enumerate grounds for refusal, but if it doesn’t list “exceeding MSGC limit” then Registrar cannot legally reject on that basis alone[82][83]. This was identified as a gap. - So historically, MSLR would still register some PMTs even if the member was technically over the policy limit, though MSGC was concerned about those outliers. The Land Policy itself might not have had strong enforcement teeth without regulatory backing. - The modernization aims to address this by at least monitoring and flagging such cases, and by recommending regulation changes to allow enforcement. Meanwhile, MSGC can consider policy amendments too. So this policy delineates what MSLR will enforce now, and what it will do when it can’t directly enforce.
Policy Statement: - MSLR will enforce acreage limits for new Métis Title registrations in accordance with the MSGC Land Policy[84][85]. That means if a member applying for a new Métis Title (probably converting a PMT to title, or being allocated a new title) would exceed the allowed acreage cap, MSLR will not register that Title. Essentially, the Registrar can refuse to issue a new patent if doing so breaks the rules. This is likely supported by the fact that MSGC and Settlement have to approve a new patent anyway, so presumably they wouldn’t approve it if over-limit. MSLR just adds the check as a safeguard. - For PMT and Allotment transactions (which might include initial allocations or transfers of those interest types) that cause a member to exceed the limit, MSLR will flag the issue but cannot legally reject the registration absent a regulatory amendment[86][87]. This acknowledges the legal constraint: if law doesn’t allow refusal, MSLR must register but can note it as over policy. - In those cases, notifications will be sent to the member and the relevant Settlement Council informing them that the transaction puts the member over the recommended limit, for advisory purposes. So everyone is aware. - Essentially, MSLR’s stance: we uphold the rule where we clearly can (Métis Title issuance), and we highlight but not halt in cases we currently cannot (PMT/Allotment), pending changes to law/policy.
Implementation: - The Digital Portal will have an automated holdings calculator[88][89]. When a transaction is initiated involving adding land to a member, the system sums the total acreage the member will have if this goes through. It compares to the MSGC cap. - If the result is over limit, the system: - If it’s a Métis Title issuance, likely prevents final approval (maybe requires an override by MSGC if exceptional) and flags that it cannot proceed. - If it’s a PMT/Allotment, it allows submission but tags it as “exceeds land policy limit” in the review interface. - MSLR staff, upon seeing a flagged submission for PMT/Allotment, will ensure that: - They still process it (since no rule to reject), but they include in the issuance letter or certificate a note of the exceedance. - Immediately, the system or staff generate exceedance reports or notifications. - Regular Reports: The policy calls for regular reports of members exceeding limits to be generated for MSGC and Settlement councils[90][91]. For example, a quarterly report listing any members who currently hold over 175 acres (or the configured limit) and by how much. This keeps the political side informed and possibly spurs them to address situations (maybe ask the member to justify or, in the future, not allow conversion of those PMTs to full title). - Manual Review: For any flagged case, MSLR will do a manual check to ensure it’s calculated correctly and that there’s truly no legal basis to refuse. E.g., verify that no special exemption was granted by MSGC that we should be aware of. Ultimately, they proceed in line with authority limits[92][93]. - Work with MSGC to possibly pursue: - Regulation amendment: MSLR might formally recommend adding a clause to allow refusal of registration if over limit. Or to make PMTs subject to the same cap by law. - Or MSGC might unify the policy to simpler terms (the old excerpt [24] lines 139-148 suggests possibly going to an overall 342 cap instead of the two-tier). - But those are long-term; short-term, it’s monitor and inform.
Impacts: - Equity Promotion: Enforcing the limits for Titles and shining a light on exceedances promotes the equitable land distribution intention of the Land Policy[94]. It prevents blatant accumulation beyond what’s fair – at least at the final title stage. Members will know they can’t easily convert PMTs to Title if it breaks the limit; this might disincentivize holding too much in PMT as well, since you couldn’t get it all to patent anyway. - Awaits Legislative Change: By openly stating MSLR’s inability to enforce in some areas, it also calls attention to the need for legislative change. The General Council and province likely will take note and hopefully act. Until then, the compromise is transparency: everyone sees who’s over. - Transparency and Pressure: The reporting to councils and MSGC could create community pressure on those with large land holdings to perhaps relinquish some or at least no further allocations will be granted to them by councils. It ensures the issue isn’t hidden. - No Surprises: Members who submit transactions will be immediately warned if it’s over the limit. Even if MSLR processes it, the member can’t later say “I didn’t know.” This could encourage them to seek a council exemption beforehand if such exists or just to be aware that they are an outlier. - ARLO Alignment: Automation of these kinds of rule checks aligns with ARLO’s approach to business rules automation[94][95]. Land Titles might not have an exact analogous cap, but in corporate registries or others, automated thresholds exist. Here it’s a custom rule for MSLR, showing the portal’s flexibility. - Respecting Legal Nuance: The policy carefully respects Métis-specific nuance – that currently the law doesn’t fully empower enforcement[87]. It thus avoids legal challenges that could arise if a member was denied a registration without explicit authority. Instead it chooses a persuasive approach. This protects MSLR from litigation for acting beyond powers. - Preparation for Future Enforcement: If/when the regulation is amended to allow refusal, MSLR will already have the system in place to simply switch from “flag and allow” to “flag and block” for PMTs. So this policy sets the stage for that scenario.
In effect, Policy 10 maintains the spirit of land holding limits in the interim and lays groundwork for full enforcement once the legal framework catches up. It balances the communal goal of fair land distribution with the current legal reality.
Policy 11 – Interests on Unsurveyed Land
Date of Original Approval: July 26, 2007    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Large portions of Metis Settlement land historically have been unsurveyed, meaning they do not have formally registered parcel boundaries or plans. However, members may hold interests (allocations, traditional land use areas, etc.) in these unsurveyed lands. The challenge for the MSLR is how to record and describe these interests in a way that is clear and enforceable until proper surveys can be done. In the past, temporary descriptions (like “NE quarter of such and such, approx 100 acres from point X to creek Y”) were used, which are not very precise. With digital tools (GPS, GIS), we can do better interim solutions. This policy provides methods for registering interests in unsurveyed lands with acceptable descriptors and flags them for future survey requirements, bridging the gap until formal surveys occur.
Policy Statement: When an interest lies in unsurveyed territory, it may still be registered/recorded in MSLR using one or more of the following temporary description methods: - Alberta Township System (ATS) descriptions: If the area can be reasonably described by the ATS notation (township, range, section, quarter) even without a survey plan, that can be used. Often unsurveyed lands still fall in an ATS grid; e.g., “NW 1/4 of Section 12, Twp 95, Rge 5, W5M” can describe ~160 acres even if not formally surveyed as a parcel. - GPS Coordinates: Using latitude/longitude or UTM coordinates to mark key boundary points of the interest, meeting certain accuracy standards (likely requiring sub-meter accuracy or so). This leverages modern GPS to define the area. - Natural/Artificial Boundary references: Using physical features such as “bounded by the river to the east, by the old road to the west, etc.” if those features are identifiable and relatively stable. Or “within the fenced area of X”. - Qualified Sketch Plans: A sketch drawn (preferably by a surveyor or technician) that roughly shows the interest area in relation to known points, which can be attached to the registration as a reference.
Any unsurveyed interest recorded this way will be flagged for needing a formal survey in the future before any subdivision or further transfer occurs[96][97]. Essentially, it allows use of the land and recognition of rights now, but notes that a survey is required to finalize it into a proper parcel if it ever needs to be separated or fully titled.
Implementation: - The Digital Portal will include a spatial recording module where one can input coordinates or upload a sketch for an unsurveyed interest[98][99]. - If a survey plan file isn’t provided (because none exists), the system will ask for alternate description input. For example, it might provide an interface to draw a polygon on a map approximating the area, or to input coordinate points. - It could also prompt to attach any document like a sketch or written description. - MSLR staff will review such submissions carefully to ensure they meet an “acceptable description” threshold (maybe have at least one reliable reference point). - These interests, once recorded, will be marked in the registry as “unsurveyed – pending survey.” The GIS will show them as provisional shapes. They might not appear on the official cadastral map except perhaps as a highlighted area. - Integration with GIS: The coordinates/sketch will be stored, which improves over just textual descriptions in legacy. It gives a visual of roughly where the interest is, aiding future surveyors or administrators. - Settlement Councils’ role: Settlements will be asked to prioritize surveying of lands that have active interests but no plan[100][101]. Perhaps through their Land Use or Special Projects, they may allocate budget or press government to survey those. MSLR can provide them a list of unsurveyed recorded interests as targets for survey. - Member obligations: Members holding such interests will be required to cooperate when survey time comes – e.g., update their description or allow surveyors access. Also, if they want to subdivide or do something major with that land, they must get it surveyed first. - If/when a survey is done, the interest will then be updated to refer to the new plan (fulfilling the flag). - If multiple unsurveyed interests overlap inadvertently (due to poor descriptions), MSLR and Settlement might have to mediate or clarify the boundaries with those members, perhaps an MSAT referral if disputes.
Impacts: - Continuity of Rights: Members are not prevented from registering their interests just because land isn’t surveyed. This is important to support member rights even in remote or previously unsurveyed areas[102]. It means their interest is recognized in the registry, giving them some security, albeit with a note that more precision is needed later. - Improved Interim Accuracy: By using coordinates and digital mapping, the descriptions of unsurveyed interests will be more accurate than before, reducing confusion. The error margin shrinks compared to vague descriptions, thus addressing some integration issues with existing maps[103]. - Encourages Formal Surveys: Flagging them for future survey ensures the issue isn’t forgotten. Over time, the goal would be to have fewer and fewer unsurveyed active interests as they get systematically surveyed. This policy thus supports long-term registry accuracy and completeness. - Avoids Freezing Land Use: Without this policy, one might have said “you can’t register anything until surveyed,” which could freeze legitimate land use or transfers for potentially years. This approach avoids that scenario, allowing life to go on while still planning for improvement. - Potential for Minor Disputes: On the flip side, provisional descriptions may lead to occasional boundary disagreements between neighbors if things weren’t clear. But by logging something in the registry, at least there’s a starting point for resolution, and all parties know a survey will be the final arbitrator. - Alignment with ARLO Mapping: ARLO might not have “unsurveyed” concept (since all titled land in Alberta is surveyed), but in spirit, integrating unsurveyed interest data into a GIS is an innovative use of technology to handle unique Indigenous land scenarios. - Data for Survey Prioritization: The collection of coordinates and sketches for unsurveyed interests effectively creates a preliminary map. Surveyors can use this to plan actual surveys, likely saving time (they have an idea of what to expect). It could also be used to justify funding for surveys by showing how many interests need formalization.
Overall, Policy 11 enables MSLR to maintain continuity of land records in unsurveyed areas in a sensible way, until such time as full legal surveys catch up – which ultimately reinforces the integrity of the registry and the security of tenure for members in those areas.
Policy 12 – Allocation Interests
Date of Original Approval: July 26, 2007    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Allocation interests are a form of temporary land holding typically granted by a Settlement Council to a member, often pending the member meeting certain conditions to convert it to a more permanent interest (like a PMT or Métis Title). Historically, some allocations remained in a sort of perpetual pending state – members held them for long periods without converting to title, sometimes beyond intended time limits. This created uncertainty and potentially hoarding of land without commitment. Also, rules on transferability of allocations were limited (to prevent speculation). The policy ensures allocation interests have defined terms and oversight so they don’t become quasi-permanent without proper process.
Policy Statement: - Defined Term for Allocations: Every allocation interest will be given a specified term (expiry date) instead of being open-ended[104][105]. For example, a Settlement might allocate a plot to a member and say “you have 5 years to develop this and convert it to PMT or it expires.” - Requirement to Convert or Renew: The holder must either convert the allocation to a permanent interest before expiry or get a renewal approval from the Settlement Council before it expires[105]. If neither happens, the allocation will expire and be cancelled (like PMTs). - Cancellation of Expired Allocations: If an allocation expires without conversion or renewal, it will be cancelled (removed from the registry)[105]. This frees the land to go back into the Settlement’s control for reallocation. - Limited Transfer Rights: Transfer of allocations is restricted as per MSGC Land Policy[106][107]. Typically, allocations weren’t freely transferable; maybe only to another member with Council approval, if at all. The policy reaffirms that; any transfer has to abide by policy (likely requiring council consent and only in certain cases like to immediate family).
In short, treat allocations like provisional permits that must either progress to something or end.
Implementation: - For each allocation recorded, MSLR will ensure an expiry date is recorded in the system. Many existing ones might not have had one; MSLR might coordinate with Settlement Councils to assign reasonable terms to old allocations (e.g., default 5 years from now unless council sets otherwise). - The Digital Portal will track these terms similar to PMTs – sending expiry reminders to allocation holders and councils just like Policy 2 does for PMTs[108][109]. So 60-day letters or similar courtesy notices will apply to allocations as well, as needed. - The portal could also have a “convert allocation” guided workflow for members ready to turn it into PMT or Title, which would walk them through steps and notify Council for approval etc.[108][109]. - Settlement Councils will receive notifications of upcoming allocation expiries and any renewal requests via the portal[110][111]. This prompts them to make a decision: either let it expire or formally extend it via resolution. - If a renewal is approved by Council, MSLR updates the new expiry date accordingly. - If the term passes with no renewal or conversion, the cancellation process kicks in (again, similar to PMT cancellations – a notice then cancellation if no objection). - For transfers: If someone wants to transfer an allocation (say member A to member B, maybe due to moving or something), MSLR will require evidence of Settlement Council approval (since likely council must approve any change of who gets an allocation). The system will treat it akin to a new allocation for B and cancellation for A if approved. - Train Settlement Land Administrators to be aware of these rules so they advise members accordingly – e.g., “don’t sit on an allocation indefinitely, you’ll lose it after X years if you don’t fulfill requirements.”
Impacts: - Prevents Land Banking: Members can’t hold allocation land indefinitely without developing or committing. This policy ensures timely transition or relinquishment, preventing land from being tied up unproductively (“stagnation” of land interests is reduced[112][113]). - Encourages Commitment: If a member truly wants the land, they’ll work to meet conditions and convert to PMT/Title. If not, they know they can’t just hold it forever without action. This might result in some allocations being let go and reallocated to others who will use them, benefiting the community. - Digital Tracking: The system’s reminders and tracking reduce oversight errors – no allocation should be forgotten or linger just because everyone forgot its status[113]. It will be surfaced when due. - Council Oversight Strengthened: Councils are looped in regularly, reinforcing that allocations are a Council-granted privilege that needs their ongoing sanction to continue beyond initial term[114][112]. This aligns with self-governance: council retains control to extend or not, rather than things just auto-continuing. - Fairness: Setting formal terms for all allocations and renewing deliberately ensures fairness – everyone’s on a clock, and extensions likely have to be justified. - Administrative Similarity to PMTs: It brings allocations in line with how PMTs are handled (terms, renewals), which simplifies the mental model for staff and members – basically any conditional land holding has an expiry to watch. - Records Cleanup: Over time, old lingering allocation entries will either convert or be removed, cleaning up the registry of “ghost” interests that should have been resolved. - Balance automation and community control: The policy automates reminders and processes but leaves the decision to renew to councils, thereby balancing modernization with community control[115][116] (as the impact says: council oversight is maintained, community control balanced with automation). - Member Communication: It will be important that current allocation holders are informed of these rules (maybe they were already since 2007, but reiterate). Possibly a grace period for older ones might be given to not abruptly cancel those who were never told of an expiry – maybe ask councils to set an expiry for them now and notify the holder.
Policy 12 thus introduces necessary discipline into the handling of allocations, aligning them with modern management practices and ensuring they serve as a stepping stone to full ownership rather than an indefinite state.
Policy 13 – Survey Plan Requirements
Date of Original Approval: January 25, 2009    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Accurate survey plans are essential for defining land boundaries and ensuring valid registrations. In the Settlement context, any new parcel or interest should have a survey plan approved to avoid overlaps or uncertainty. Settlements also have a role – they typically must approve new surveys or boundary changes in their territory. This policy consolidates requirements drawn from law (Surveys Act, MSA) and practice: - Plans must be done by licensed surveyors, - Must show all necessary details (boundaries, easements, etc.), - Use modern formats (linking to Policy 8’s digital preference), - Require Settlement’s explicit approval for surveys that carve up Settlement land.
Policy Statement: - Licensed Surveyors: All survey plans submitted must be prepared and signed by an Alberta Land Surveyor (ALS) in good standing, as required by law and the Surveys Act[117][118]. No DIY sketches for formal registration (Policy 11’s sketches are an interim for unsurveyed but eventually those too need ALS plans). - Content of Plans: Plans must include all relevant details: - ATS coordinates or geographic coordinates (to situate the parcel precisely). - All easements, rights-of-way, and encumbrances affecting the land should be shown[117][118] (e.g., utility lines, roads, etc.). This is important because Settlement lands often have utility corridors or traditional trails, etc., that should be noted. - Any encumbrances (like a mortgage or caveat) if known at time of survey? Usually encumbrances aren’t on survey plans, but maybe on Settlement lands they mark certain customary use areas. Nonetheless, listing them implies the plan should present a full picture of burdens on the land. - Digital Submission Preferred: As echoed from Policy 8, digital CAD format submissions are preferred, and these should be validated via ARLO integration[119][120]. If paper is submitted, it’s accepted but digital is the goal. - Settlement Council Approval Required: No new survey within Settlement boundaries is considered final unless the Settlement Council has approved it[119][121]. This ties to MSA (likely a requirement in MSA or Land Policy) that the local council must consent to any survey that delineates land for a member, since it affects the community land base. Essentially, a survey plan that subdivides or defines a parcel for a Métis title likely comes with a Council resolution, or the survey could even be initiated by Council. MSLR will ask for proof of such approval.
Implementation: - MSLR will verify surveyor credentials for each plan. Possibly through the portal integration with the ALS Association (like verifying the surveyor’s signature certificate). - The portal’s upload validation will check for correct format and might extract meta-data to see if coordinates present, etc.[122][123]. - MSLR staff reviewing a plan will look for an ALS signature (digital or ink) and that the plan has all necessary features (scale, legend of easements, etc.). A checklist will be used to ensure completeness. - If a plan is missing Council approval evidence, MSLR will not register it until that is provided. So likely require a Council-signed document or stamp on the plan. Implementation might be: the portal allows council to digitally sign-off or upload an approval letter which then gets attached. Or if council provided a resolution number, that can be cross-checked. - The portal will route a digital copy of submitted plans to Settlement Council (perhaps automatically if it’s their settlement) for their records or approval if not yet given[124][125]. - If a plan is submitted without prior council approval, the system might notify the council and mark pending until they approve (some coordination needed). - Paper plans: if some still come by mail, MSLR will digitize them (scan) for integration, but will still require that official council stamp on it.
Impacts: - Legal and Spatial Accuracy Ensured: Requiring licensed surveyors and detailed plan content means all registered boundaries are legally defensible and less prone to error[126]. It ensures, for example, that if a power line crosses the parcel, it’s noted, preventing future conflict. - Integration with Provincial System: Digital plans validated with ARLO means MSLR’s spatial data is compatible with the province’s, enhancing efficiency if info needs to be exchanged[126][127]. - Community Governance Maintained: By insisting on Settlement Council approval for surveys, the policy upholds Métis governance – councils have a say in any new parcel creation or boundary definition on their land[128][129]. This prevents unilateral actions that might bypass community planning. - Preventing Unauthorized Surveys: Surveyors will know they need council sign-off, so they likely won’t even do a final plan without it. That stops, say, a member from hiring a surveyor to carve out something without the council’s blessing. - Better Records: Having all easements and such on plans centralizes important info in one place. When someone looks at a plan, they see not just the lot but also if there’s a utility line or road access. This is helpful for subsequent transactions and for Settlements in managing land (like planning infrastructure). - Transition to Digital: Encouraging digital means over time paper will phase out, aligning with modernization. Initially, scanning of paper plans ensures no loss of info, but gradually, less scanning needed as digital becomes norm. - Confidence for Members: Members obtaining title can be confident that their boundaries are properly surveyed and approved by their community – no hidden issues likely because everything is depicted. That fosters trust in the security of their land interest. - Workload: Possibly additional work for Settlement councils to formally approve every new survey (if not already doing so). They might need to pass more motions or sign more plans. But it’s part of governance – some were already doing it systematically, others may tighten up now. - Balance modernization and tradition: The policy explicitly mentions balancing modernization (digital, integration) with tradition (council oversight)[130][128], showing that improved efficiency doesn’t come at cost of local control.
Policy 13 thus cements high standards for survey plans, preventing sloppy or unauthorized parcel creation and ensuring every piece of Settlement land on the registry has a solid legal foundation and community approval.
Policy 14 – Document Alterations and Corrections
Date of Original Approval: March 15, 2009    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: Occasionally, errors or necessary changes in registry documents occur – e.g., a typo in a member’s name on a title, an incorrect legal description, or an outdated information that needs correction. However, altering official registry records must be done carefully to maintain integrity and trust. In the past, some corrections were made without clear documentation, which could raise questions later. This policy delineates what kinds of corrections MSLR staff can do in-house (minor errors) and what kinds need a formal reapplication or even court involvement (substantive changes). It also requires logging all changes for transparency, and involving Settlement councils if a correction affects their interests.
Policy Statement: - Minor Clerical Errors: MSLR staff are permitted to correct minor clerical errors in registry entries, provided they have proper documented justification for the correction[131][132]. Examples of minor errors: spelling mistakes in names, transposed digits in an instrument number, minor typos in descriptions that don’t alter meaning significantly. For each such correction, staff must record why it was an error (e.g., “member ID was entered incorrectly, verified against application form”). - Substantive Changes: Any change that affects the substance of the interest – such as changing the name of the interest holder to a different person (not just spelling), altering the land description to a different parcel, changing the terms of an interest, etc. – cannot be done just by staff. These require either: - A new application from the parties (e.g., if they want to change who holds the interest, they need to formally transfer it, not just “correct” it). - Or a court order directing the change, or an MSAT order if within their jurisdiction, or an explicit legal authority under the MSA[131][133]. - Documentation of Corrections: Any correction made will be noted in the registry along with the date, reason, and who authorized it[134][135]. The idea is to have an audit trail – if someone later sees a discrepancy, there’s a note “Corrected on 2025-08-01 by Registrar: legal description lot number fixed from 12 to 21 – typo in original entry.” - Archiving Original Documents: The original erroneous document (perhaps the original instrument submitted or an original certificate issued) will be digitally archived and preserved for audit purposes[134][136]. So, if we correct something, we keep the old version on file as historical record. - Settlement Council Approval for Impacting Corrections: If the correction being made has an impact on Settlement interests or authority, the Settlement council must approve it[137][138]. For example, if there was an error in something that alters council’s obligations or rights (say, a boundary affecting Settlement land, or membership class that determines voting rights?), the council should sign off. This ensures transparency with local government on anything non-trivial.
Implementation: - Develop a Corrections Log in the digital system. Perhaps each interest or document record has a “modification history” where changes are appended. - For any minor correction, staff must fill out a short electronic form stating what was corrected and why, which then becomes part of record[139][140]. - If a more substantive change is requested (like someone says “the wrong person was listed as owner”), staff will inform them that a new instrument (transfer) or an appeal to MSAT/court is needed. They cannot just alter it. - If a court/Tribunal order is presented, staff will verify authenticity and then implement the change, referencing the order number/date in the log. - E-signatures or sign-off by a manager might be required on each correction form to ensure oversight (so staff doesn’t unilaterally change things without second pair of eyes). - Digital Portal: If an error is discovered by a user, they might be able to submit a “correction request” digitally, describing the issue and uploading evidence. MSLR reviews and either corrects it if minor or instructs them on formal steps if not. The policy indicates such request should come with electronic signatures, etc., similar to ARLO’s model[139][141]. - Notifying Settlement council: e.g., if a correction changes a land description that might affect boundaries, send the plan to council for info/approval. Or if an interest was incorrectly recorded and now being removed or added, council should be informed especially if it’s something they should have been involved in (like a lease of common land or something). - Periodic audit: perhaps internal audit will occasionally review correction logs to ensure policy followed.
Impacts: - Registry Integrity: Maintains high integrity by ensuring no material changes are made off the record or without authority[142][143]. This builds trust that the registry is reliable and changes are legitimate. - Transparency: With an audit trail for every correction, there’s accountability. If ever questioned (in court or by an auditor), the record shows exactly what was done and why. - User Confidence: Members and stakeholders can be confident that simple mistakes can be fixed (so they’re not stuck with a misspelled name), but also that bigger changes won’t happen behind the scenes. They know the process for significant alterations is formal (so nobody can just alter who owns land without due process). - Prevents Fraud/Abuse: The policy indirectly prevents any potential fraudulent changes because no staff can just decide to change an owner or interest terms. Those must go through proper channels, making it very hard to fabricate a “correction” that is actually a malicious change. - Record Preservation: By keeping original documents archived, the registry doesn’t lose historical data. This can be important legally if disputes arise about what happened. (E.g., someone claims the original said X – MSLR can produce the original to show error and correction path.) - Council Oversight: Requiring council approval on impactful corrections ensures that MSLR doesn’t inadvertently override local authority. It’s possible a correction might mean re-issuing something that a council originally signed; they should concur to maintain their trust. This fosters cooperation and oversight across governance levels[142][144]. - Efficiency vs. Rigor: The policy finds a balance: trivial errors can be fixed quickly (efficient), but anything non-trivial goes through the rigorous proper channels. That prevents MSLR from getting bogged down (imagine requiring a court order to fix a typo – that would be too slow, so allowing minor fixes is pragmatic). - Digital Audit Trails: This aligns with modernization themes of digital audit logs and security[142][145]. It addresses earlier ERM concerns about unauthorized changes – now, any change is logged and likely can be monitored.
In summary, Policy 14 ensures that registry records are correct and credible, by allowing necessary minor corrections (with documentation) and forbidding unapproved substantive changes, thereby protecting the sanctity of the registered information.
Policy 15 – MSLR Counter Service
Date of Original Approval: October 1, 2009    Updated: July 25, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: In the early years of the MSLR (post-1990), registry staff often helped Settlement members fill out forms or guide them through membership applications. Over time, it became clear this was beyond the proper role of a registry (which should be neutral and only process what’s submitted, not advocate or advise). Settlement Land Clerks and membership officers are the ones who should assist members, because they operate under Settlement/MSGC authority and know local context. Continuing the old approach risked conflicts of interest and blurred responsibilities. By 2009, a directive (Policy No. 15 of old guide) instructed that MSLR should refocus on being just a registry, not a one-stop advisory for land/membership questions[146][147]. The modernization reiterates that with the nuance that now we have better self-help tools (digital resources) to replace that gap.
Policy Statement: - Documents for Processing: The MSLR counter (or intake service) will accept and process documents that are complete and ready for registration, without delay[148][149]. If someone walks in with a fully executed transfer that has all needed approvals, MSLR will take it and issue a registration number, etc., promptly. - If a document is incomplete or requires a Settlement council’s authorization that isn’t there, MSLR will not process it and will instead return it to the person, directing them to get it completed via their Settlement Land Clerk or authority[150][151]. (This ties in with Policy 7 on incomplete requests – essentially the same idea but specifically at the counter context.) - Completion Assistance: MSLR staff will provide procedural information (like what forms exist, what the general process is) but will not fill out forms or provide legal interpretation or advice on the transaction[152][153]. For example, staff can say “To register a land transfer, you need Form A and a council resolution; here is the form and the checklist.” But they won’t actually write the info in the form for the person or tell them what to put. - If a client needs help beyond that (doesn’t know how to answer a question on the form, etc.), the staff will refer them to their Settlement Land Clerk (or a legal advisor if appropriate)[152][153]. - Membership Matters: MSLR will not advise on or involve itself in membership eligibility or application processes[154][155]. Any inquiries about how to become a member, whether someone qualifies for membership, or issues with membership forms are outside MSLR’s scope. Those questions are to be referred to Settlement Councils or the MSGC’s membership department, since membership is under local jurisdiction and MSGC (as per MSA Part 3). - The overall stance is: MSLR = registry that deals with paperwork after it’s in order, not a front-line advisory office for land or membership issues.
Implementation: - Staff Training: All front counter staff (and those answering phones/emails) will be trained on the boundaries of advice vs. information. They’ll have scripts or guidelines on what they can say vs when to politely direct someone elsewhere. - Develop informational materials: brochures or guides that staff can hand out or point to, that explain processes step-by-step (this is information, not tailored advice). - Portal Self-Help: The digital portal will include a comprehensive self-help resource library (guides, FAQs, maybe video tutorials) akin to ARLO’s help centre[156][157]. This allows users to find answers themselves. The chatbot might handle frequent queries about how to do X, which further reduces pressure on staff to do so. - Portal access points: Possibly at the MSLR office or Settlement offices, there could be a kiosk or computer where users can log in to the portal and follow instructions. - Referral systems: MSLR will maintain an updated contact list of each Settlement’s land office or membership clerk so they can easily refer a client: “Please contact [Name] at [Settlement] office for help with that form.” - If someone really insists on help filling a form at MSLR, staff must kindly decline and stick to policy, offering alternatives (like “We can witness your signature if needed, but we cannot complete it for you” which was even in old directive item 3[158]). - MSLR will also not offer any legal advice if a query is legal in nature (“Should I add my son’s name to my title?” — refer them to a lawyer or Settlement). - No membership consulting: If someone starts asking about membership (like “I was removed from membership, what can I do?”), staff will direct them to MSGC membership or Appeal Tribunal as appropriate.
Impacts: - Clarified Role: This policy clearly delineates MSLR’s role, thus improving focus on its core function[148][159]. Staff can devote time to processing rather than hand-holding, which should improve efficiency and reduce backlog. - Empowers Settlements: Pushing advisory roles back to Settlement offices ensures those offices remain the primary source of community support, consistent with Métis self-governance and the idea that each Settlement handles its members’ needs[154][155]. It prevents any sense that “the Edmonton office (MSLR) is running the show” in membership or local matters. - Reduces Liability: MSLR staff giving advice could lead to liability if something goes wrong (“They told me this was fine, but now council rejected it…”). By not giving advice, MSLR avoids such situations. - Consistency and Equality: Staff only provide procedural info ensures everyone gets the same standard guidance, not varying quality of advice or potential incorrect info from a well-meaning clerk. Now it’s either documented info or referral. - Self-Service Tools: Investing in a robust help centre and resources means many clients will be able to self-serve for basic questions, which in today’s era many prefer. It aligns with ARLO’s user-centric design where forms are guided and help is one click away[156][157]. - Community Capacity Building: If Settlement Land Clerks know inquiries will come to them, they might up their knowledge and capacity, which is good in the long run. It also fosters direct member-council interaction, which can be beneficial for local governance. - Member Experience: Some members who are used to old ways might initially feel they’re being “turned away” by MSLR when not helped. But with good communication explaining roles and providing alternate support (like “here’s the tutorial, and your local clerk can help”), they’ll adapt. The ultimate experience might even be better because their local clerk understands their context better and can help more thoroughly. - Focus on Core Services: Freed from quasi-consulting, MSLR can concentrate on reducing turnaround times for actual registrations, improving the registry’s performance. The policy notes this enhances focus on core functions[160].
In summary, Policy 15 reinforces that MSLR is a registry, not a public advisory office, aligning with standard practice (land titles offices also do not fill forms for you or advise on content). It ensures members get help from the right place (their community offices or self-help) and that MSLR stays neutral and efficient.
Policy 16 – Digital Portal Access and Security
Date of Original Approval: January 1, 2025    Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: <u>____________________</u>
Context: The new MSLR Digital Portal opens up online access to the land registry for various stakeholders. While this greatly improves accessibility, it introduces significant security concerns. The portal will contain sensitive personal and land information, and also functionality to perform transactions. Past risk assessments likely flagged vulnerabilities in older systems (maybe weak logins or potential cyber threats). Also, MSA s.98 restrictions mean only certain people should access certain info, which the portal must enforce. We take cues from ARLO’s security model – which likely includes strong identity verification and multi-factor auth, given Land Titles deals with high-value assets. This policy enumerates security and access protocols to ensure the digital platform is trustworthy.
Policy Statement: - Verified Registration for Portal Users: Anyone who wants access to the MSLR Portal must register and have their identity verified and be assigned the appropriate role permissions[161][162]. For members, that means confirming they are who they claim and linking them to their membership record. For council or staff, confirming their position. For external professionals (if any, e.g., surveyors), verifying credentials. - Role-Based Permissions: The access granted is role-specific, per MSA s.98 (only see what you’re allowed)[161][163]. For example, an ordinary member can see their own records and general public info, but not the entire members list. A Settlement Administrator login can see their settlement’s records. MSGC might see aggregated data. Each role’s scope is defined and enforced by the system. - Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): All portal users must use MFA to log in[161][164]. This typically means, besides password, a second factor like a code sent to phone or an authenticator app. This drastically reduces the risk of compromised accounts, which is crucial for protecting land records. - Session Security: Sessions on the portal will have an automatic timeout after a period of inactivity[165]. This prevents someone from walking away and leaving a session open for another to exploit. It also mitigates some risk of hijacked sessions. - Activity Logging and Monitoring: All user activities on the portal are logged and monitored[165][166]. If someone views a document, submits a form, downloads something – it’s recorded. The security team or audit system will monitor these logs for suspicious behavior (like an account pulling large amounts of data at odd hours, etc.). - Alerts and Lockouts: If unauthorized access attempts are detected (e.g., multiple failed logins, attempt to access forbidden data), the system will trigger alerts to admins and possibly lock the account to prevent breach[165][167]. This might also include IP blocking if needed.
Essentially, a comprehensive security posture akin to what modern online banking or government services employ.
Implementation: - Identity Verification Process: For members: at initial registration, require entry of personal info that matches the Members List, and then perhaps a two-step verification (like video call or in-person showing ID at Settlement office, or using MyAlberta Digital ID if integrated). For council/staff, verification through official channels (Ministry/Settlement). - Possibly integrate with GoA’s MyAlberta ID system to leverage their verified identity methods for general users, but additional step to confirm membership status. - Role assignment: Based on verification, assign the user a role in the system (member, councilor, clerk, etc.) which automatically grants certain access. - MFA: Use an industry standard solution (SMS 2FA, authenticator apps, etc.). Provide guidance to users on setting that up. Possibly provide alternative for those without cell coverage (hardware token if needed). - Session Timeout: Configure portal to log out idle sessions after, say, 15 minutes (with warning maybe). - Audit logs: Build an audit trail feature where everything is logged with timestamp and user ID. Ensure logs are stored securely and reviewable. - Intrusion detection: Possibly use software to analyze log patterns and alert on anomalies. Also have admin dashboard for active sessions to spot anything weird. - Regular Security Audits: As policy mentions, do regular security testing and audits of the portal, including penetration tests, to find and fix vulnerabilities (learning from ARLO’s iterative improvements)[168]. - User Security Training: Provide training materials or required short course for certain users (maybe staff, council) about security best practices – like not sharing passwords, recognizing phishing, etc.[168][169]. Possibly even an interactive tutorial on first login for members to emphasize protecting their account. - Emergency Protocols: If a breach occurs or suspected, have protocol to shut down or isolate part of system, notify affected users, etc.
Impacts: - Data Protection: These measures greatly mitigate risks of data breach or corruption[170][171]. It aligns with earlier risk assessments that called out data corruption as a risk to mitigate. If a hacker tries, MFA and monitoring make it hard, and any successful attempt would likely be caught quickly. - Trust in Digital System: Members and leaders will trust the new system only if they see it’s secure. Knowing that strong security is in place (two-factor, verification) gives confidence to use it for important transactions, thus enabling adoption. If there were a security incident, trust would plummet; this policy aims to prevent that. - Accessibility vs Security: Requiring MFA and verified sign-up can be a hurdle for some, but it’s necessary. The policy acknowledges digital divide issues, but addresses them by offering user training and alternatives rather than weakening security[171]. Over time, users adapt to MFA as normal (like many do for banking). - Accountability: Role-based logs create accountability (e.g., if a staff member accessed a record improperly, it’s logged; they can be held responsible). This deters internal misuse too. - Continuous Improvement: Regular audits mean the system will evolve to address new threats, which is crucial as cyber threats change. The reference to ARLO’s iterative model suggests we’ll incorporate ongoing lessons[172]. - 24/7 Access with Integrity: Ultimately, this allows offering 24/7 online access to users while maintaining trust that the system’s integrity isn’t compromised[170][171]. That’s a cornerstone: people will only move from paper to digital if they trust it’s safe. With these measures, they can have that trust. - Digital Divide: Training and accessibility measures ensure no one is left vulnerable or unable to use the system due to security complexity[173]. For instance, assisting elders in setting up accounts and MFA, or providing in-person help. The policy notes this to ensure modernization doesn’t exclude folks.
Policy 16 is essentially the cybersecurity backbone of the MSLR modernization, ensuring that the move to digital does not expose sensitive land information to unauthorized access and that users can confidently use the system.
________________________________________
This concludes the detailed consolidated policy framework. Each policy above has been carefully crafted to incorporate both the unique substantive content of previous drafts and to avoid duplication. Redundant points were merged, and terminology was standardized across policies. Citations of relevant legislation (MSA, MSLR Reg) and MSGC policies have been integrated where appropriate to lend authority and clarity. All policies align with the Foundational Principles stated earlier and support the overarching modernization objectives.
Implementation Model
With the consolidated policy framework established, the next step is execution. The implementation of the MSLR modernization will be approached in phases, with attention to change management, capacity building, and technical roll-out:
Phase 1: Preparation (Q1–Q2 2025)
- Legislative & Policy Alignment: Formally communicate with the Metis Settlements General Council about any required policy amendments on their end (e.g., confirm Land Policy details on limits, discuss regulatory amendment needs for enforcing caps as identified in Policy 10). Begin the process with Alberta Indigenous Relations and Justice to draft potential amendments to the MSLR Regulation (though these may run parallel and not hold up other actions).
- Stakeholder Engagement: Present the Modernization Policy Book to Settlement Councils and MSGC for feedback and endorsement. Early buy-in from these stakeholders is crucial for smooth implementation. Incorporate minor adjustments if critical issues are raised (while maintaining the core content).
- Technical Development: Finalize development of the MSLR Digital Portal. Ensure all features described in policies (automated notices, role-based access, GIS integration, etc.) are built and tested. Work closely with the Alberta Land Titles modernization team to leverage ARLO components (like security and map integration).
- Data Migration: Migrate existing digital records into the new system. Scan remaining paper records (older titles, plans, estate instructions) to have digital copies. Convert AutoCAD spatial files into the GIS as per Policy 8. Verify data integrity post-migration.
- Training Materials: Develop user guides, quick reference sheets, and online tutorials. Prepare a training program for internal staff, Settlement office staff, and an orientation for external users (members, etc.) on how to use the new portal and understand new policies.
Phase 2: Pilot and Capacity Building (Q3 2025)
- Pilot Launch: Select one or two Metis Settlements to pilot the new system and policies in a controlled manner. For example, test the full digital submission process on those Settlements, including issuing digital notices, handling an objection, processing an estate instruction, etc., to ensure all workflows function as intended. Use pilot feedback to tweak portal usability or clarify policy implementation steps.
- Staff Training: Conduct comprehensive training for MSLR staff on the new system and policy enforcement. Include scenario-based exercises (e.g., handling an incomplete request at the counter, performing a correction with logging, verifying an estate instruction scenario). Similarly, train Settlement Land Clerks and Administrators on their roles – such as approving subdivision plans digitally (Policy 13) or helping members with digital submissions (Policy 15’s referral aspect).
- Community Awareness: Roll out a communication campaign in pilot Settlements (and generally prepare for all Settlements). Hold community information sessions to explain the new portal and key policy changes. Provide step-by-step examples: “How do I renew my PMT online,” “What happens if I don’t renew – here’s the 60-day letter process,” “How to file estate instructions now,” etc. Emphasize benefits (faster service, better transparency) and support available. Solicit and address questions or concerns (for example, reassure elders that paper is still accepted if needed, or that help will be provided to learn the portal).
Phase 3: Full Roll-out (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)
- Go-Live: Following successful pilot outcomes, launch the digital portal and new processes for all Metis Settlements. This will likely be staggered – e.g., a cluster of Settlements go live each month – to manage the load and provide focused support. During go-live, have support staff on standby (a helpdesk) to resolve any technical issues or confusion in real-time.
- Transition Arrangements: During the initial months of roll-out, accept both old and new ways in parallel where needed. For instance, if a member still submits an old paper form that doesn’t fully comply, process it but educate them that next time the digital or new form is required. Similarly, allow a grace period for things like adding expiry dates to old allocations (Policy 12) – coordinate with Settlement Councils to formalize those within a set timeframe (e.g., by mid-2026).
- Data Verification: Continuously verify that new entries and migrated data in the portal are accurate. Conduct random audits of transactions done via portal vs. expectations (e.g., ensure a digital notice indeed went out 60 days prior, check that an automated deficiency notice correctly identified missing info, etc.). This ensures the automation is functioning correctly and fine-tune if any discrepancy.
•	Support and Feedback Loop: Maintain an active feedback channel. Encourage members and staff to report any difficulties or suggestions. Perhaps form a “Modernization Working Group” with representatives from each Settlement to meet periodically and discuss how the new system and policies are working on the ground. Immediately address any critical issues (for example, if it turns out some policy step causes an unintended delay or confusion, issue a practice note or tweak procedure as allowed).
Phase 4: Stabilization and Enhancement (mid 2026 and onward)
- Monitor Performance Metrics: Evaluate against the strategic objective metrics identified. For example, track the percentage of transactions done online vs. paper, the reduction in incomplete submissions, average turnaround time for a registration, system uptime, user satisfaction surveys, etc. Publish a modernization progress report to Cabinet/MSGC highlighting successes (e.g., “Renewal compliance improved by X% due to notice system, backlog of terminations cleared from 50 cases to 0,” etc.).
- Legislative Follow-up: If not already completed, push through any agreed regulatory amendments. For instance, amending MSLR Regulation to empower enforcement of land caps (as recommended in Policy 10), or formalizing digital notice methods in regulation. Similarly, MSGC may pass complementary motions (e.g., updating Land Policy to sync with new procedures). The policy book can be updated in 2026 to reflect any legal changes (hence calling it 2025–2026 edition).
- Continuous Training: Institutionalize training for new staff and ongoing refreshers. As turnover happens, ensure knowledge transfer of these modernized practices so old habits don’t creep back. Possibly integrate training on MSLR modernization into orientation for new Settlement council members or clerks, since they play a role.
- Iterative Improvements: Based on the feedback and performance data, plan for incremental upgrades. Maybe develop new features users request (e.g., a mobile app if demand, or more integration like linking with Indigenous Services Canada database as mentioned). Also, incorporate any new government security standards or digital innovations that arise, keeping the system up-to-date.
During implementation, a Modernization Project Team will coordinate these tasks, led by the MSLR Registrar’s office with representation from MSGC, Settlement administrators, and GoA (Indigenous Relations Ministry IT and policy units). Regular reports will be made to the Metis Settlements Transition Commission (if any exists) or the department overseeing MSLR, as well as to the MSGC.
A key part of the implementation model is ensuring that the community is carried along: the changes should not feel imposed but rather a natural evolution supported by training and clear communication. The use of pilot and phased approach helps manage risk and build confidence gradually.
The timeline aims for core implementation by end of 2025, with 2026 as a year of stabilization and fine-tuning. By the end of fiscal 2025–26, the goal is to have a fully functional digital MSLR, a well-informed user base, and all legacy issues (backlogs, unsurveyed descriptions pending, etc.) significantly addressed or in a clear plan to resolution.
Accountability and Governance Structure
Successful governance of the modernized MSLR requires clarity in roles and oversight both during implementation and for ongoing operations. The following outlines the accountability framework:
•	Minister of Indigenous Relations (GoA): The Minister remains accountable to the Alberta Legislature (and Cabinet) for the overall functioning of the Metis Settlements Land Registry (as it is established by provincial law). In practice, the Minister’s role is strategic oversight – ensuring the registry meets its legislative mandate, approving regulatory changes, and responding to any escalated issues (for instance, if a matter requires Cabinet decision or involves intergovernmental agreements). The Minister will receive periodic updates on the modernization progress and may be called upon to support resource allocation for the project. For Cabinet submission purposes, the Minister would be the sponsor of this proposal, championing it through approval.
•	MSLR Registrar: The Registrar is the linchpin of the registry’s operations and is directly accountable for implementing these policies and managing day-to-day registry functions. Under MSA s.103, the Registrar is appointed as a public service official[3], and thus they report through the department’s hierarchy (likely to an Assistant Deputy Minister or similar). The Registrar’s specific accountabilities include:
•	Ensuring compliance with all policies and laws in processing transactions.
•	Making executive decisions on matters like objections (Policy 3) and corrections (Policy 14) as per policy guidelines.
•	Overseeing the MSLR staff and the functioning of the digital portal – including security enforcement (Policy 16).
•	Liaising with Settlement Councils and MSGC on issues that need their input or where disputes arise.
•	Reporting any significant irregularities or risks to the department’s leadership and working to resolve them.
•	Approving minor updates to procedures as needed to refine implementation (within the scope of the policy framework). During modernization, the Registrar will head the project team and be responsible for meeting milestones and communicating with stakeholders.
•	MSLR Staff and Deputy Registrars: The registry may have Deputy Registrars or team leads for certain areas (land, membership list, IT, etc.). The Deputy Registrar (if designated) can exercise certain powers delegated by the Registrar (per MSLR Reg s.57(1))[174], such as signing instruments or reviewing MSAT orders. Staff are accountable to follow the new policies strictly – e.g., return incomplete applications (Policy 7), not provide unauthorized advice (Policy 15), etc. Performance management will tie to adherence to these policies (for example, an error rate on issuing notices, or responding within set times).
•	Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC): The MSGC, as the collective authority for all Settlements, has an important policy role. It enacts the MSGC Land Policy and can amend it. Under the MSA, certain changes to the MSLR Regulation require consultation or initiative from MSGC[10][11]. Thus:
•	MSGC is a policy partner, expected to update its Land Policy as needed to align (for instance, clarifying land holding limits if necessary, or any membership-related policy impacted).
•	MSGC will receive regular reports from MSLR (perhaps annual or semi-annual) on key indicators – number of transactions, any issues needing GC attention (like lots of members over the land cap, or systemic issues).
•	If any dispute or question arises affecting multiple settlements or requiring a general policy (like how estate instructions are handled), MSGC would be the forum to discuss and set direction which MSLR will then implement.
•	MSGC also may coordinate training or support for Settlement councils in understanding the new processes.
•	Settlement Councils: Each of the 8 Settlement Councils holds authority over local land matters such as approvals for surveys (Policy 13), subdivisions (Policy 1), and membership issues (they forward membership terminations, etc.). Their accountability in this framework includes:
•	Promptly exercising their approval powers where required: e.g., responding to digital notifications for survey plan approvals, deciding on allocation renewals (Policy 12) within the timeframe, and issuing council resolutions where needed for members’ transactions.
•	Ensuring their Settlement Administration (Land Clerk) works closely with members to facilitate compliance – for example, helping members get the required documents so their submissions to MSLR are complete (as per Policy 7 and 15).
•	Upholding the MSGC Land Policy on the ground (they shouldn’t approve a transaction that violates the land cap expecting MSLR to sort it; rather, they should abide by the intent of the policies).
•	Settlement Councils also have an oversight interest: if they feel the registry is not operating properly in their Settlement, they can raise it to MSGC or directly to the Registrar for resolution. For instance, if notices aren’t reaching members or some technical issue arises, Council can advocate for their community.
•	Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT): The MSAT is an independent quasi-judicial body under the MSA that hears appeals on certain decisions, including land disputes and membership appeals. In the context of MSLR:
•	MSAT serves as the appeal body for members who object to cancellations (Policy 3) and are not satisfied with the Registrar’s decision, or potentially other disputes like someone challenging a registration outcome.
•	The MSLR Registrar and staff are accountable to respect and implement any MSAT orders. For example, if MSAT directs a cancelled interest to be reinstated or an allocation to be removed, the Registrar must carry that out promptly (as long as within jurisdiction).
•	The policy framework explicitly integrates MSAT’s role (e.g., in objections and allocations policies), and MSLR will maintain a cooperative relationship with MSAT: sharing information as needed for cases, referring matters that should be in MSAT’s domain (per Policy 3, referring objections directly in some cases), etc.
•	MSAT decisions might also highlight areas where policy needs tweaking, which should feed back to MSGC and the Registrar.
•	Indigenous Relations Department (GoA) – Metis Settlements Liaison/Policy Unit: Within the GoA, aside from the Registrar, there may be a branch responsible for Metis Settlements policy and legislation. That unit’s accountability:
•	Overseeing that the modernization aligns with GoA policies (digital strategy, Indigenous partnership frameworks).
•	Supporting any legislative amendments through the system (working with Legislative Counsel on reg changes, preparing Order in Council packages).
•	Ensuring funding and resources are in place (e.g., if additional budget was needed for IT development or training, liaising with Treasury).
•	Acting as a liaison between the Minister and the MSLR operations for high-level updates and issue resolution that might need Ministerial direction.
•	Audit and Compliance: Possibly, the Ministry’s internal audit or an external auditor (maybe the Auditor General) could periodically audit MSLR operations for compliance with these new policies and controls (especially the digital security and financial aspects). The Registrar would be accountable to cooperate with audits and implement recommendations.
•	User Accountability: While not an “authority” in governance, it’s worth noting that Settlement members and other users have certain responsibilities too under this framework:
•	Members must keep their addresses updated (Policy 2) – accountability for doing so lies with them; if they don’t, they bear consequences.
•	Users of the portal must safeguard their login credentials (Policy 16) and follow terms of use (likely a user agreement when they sign up). Any misuse (like trying to access unauthorized info) can lead to their account being suspended and possibly fines under MSA for unauthorized access (MSA offenses section includes contravening the Act or regulations[175]).
•	By making user responsibilities clear (e.g., every notice says “it’s your responsibility to renew; failure means cancellation”), the system enforces accountability on users as well to engage properly.
In terms of reporting structure: - The Registrar will likely report to the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) of Indigenous Relations responsible for Metis Settlements, who then reports to the Deputy Minister and Minister. The Registrar should provide quarterly updates on key metrics and any issues in implementation. - A Modernization Steering Committee might be set up (during implementation phase) composed of: the Registrar (chair), a MSGC Executive member, one Settlement Council rep, one department representative, and possibly an IT lead. This committee would monitor implementation progress and address any inter-jurisdictional issues swiftly. It would dissolve or transition into an ongoing advisory committee after implementation complete. - Post-implementation, a Governance Committee could continue, maybe annually, between MSGC and the GoA to review how the registry is operating and if any changes needed.
Accountability will also be reinforced through formal agreements if needed. For example, there may be an MOU between GoA and MSGC outlining the roles in maintaining the digital system, data sharing protocols, etc. Given data sovereignty concerns, an agreement could stipulate that all data remains property of the Metis Settlements (or the Crown) and the other party has certain usage rights, etc., ensuring clarity.
Finally, Appendix B in this document provides a summary RACI (Responsible-Accountable-Consulted-Informed) chart for all major functions (e.g., “Issue 60-day Notice – Responsible: Registrar/Staff, Accountable: Registrar, Consulted: Settlement Admin (address check), Informed: Member and Settlement Council”; “Approve subdivision – Responsible: Settlement Council, Accountable: Settlement Chair, Consulted: Registrar (for compliance check), Informed: members affected”, etc.). This can be a quick reference to avoid any ambiguity in cross-organization processes.
In conclusion, the governance structure after modernization will be one where: - Strategic oversight is shared between the GoA (for statutory compliance/digital infrastructure) and MSGC (for policy alignment), - Operational control is centralized under the Registrar (ensuring uniform application of rules and efficient service), - Local input is maintained via Settlement Councils at key decision points (subdivisions, approvals, etc.), - Independent adjudication remains in place via MSAT to handle disputes fairly, - Transparency is achieved through clear logging, reporting, and collaborative committees.
This robust accountability framework ensures that the modernized MSLR not only operates effectively day-to-day but also remains responsive to its stakeholders (government and community) and upholds the principles of Métis self-governance and partnership that underpin the entire initiative.
Appendices
Appendix A: Key Legislative and Policy References
This appendix lists relevant sections of legislation and MSGC policy that underpin the policies in the proposal, for quick reference:
•	Metis Settlements Act (RSA 2000, c M-14):
•	s.95: Effect of membership termination – land interests of a terminated member are cancelled. (Linked to Policy 5)
•	s.98: Access to Settlement Members List restricted to authorized persons[176]. (Policy 6)
•	s.103: Establishment of MSLR Registrar (Public Service appointment)[3]. (Accountability)
•	s.106: Subdivision of Settlement land must be approved by Settlement Council before registration[14][15]. (Policy 1)
•	s.110–111: (if applicable) Deals with land interests on death (mentions who can hold etc., though main policy is MSGC Land Policy sec.7.8). (Policy 9 context)
•	Part 3 (Membership): Sections on membership applications, etc., which imply MSLR not to meddle in membership (Policy 15).
•	s.239–240: Regulations process – General Council or settlements request regs, Minister consults, etc.[10][11]. (For any reg amendments needed in future)
•	s.247: Appeals to MSAT on certain decisions (implicitly covers land disputes). (Policy 3 appeals)
•	Offence provisions (s.243): Offence to contravene Act or regulations[175] – could apply to unauthorized access or false filings. (Policy 16 enforcement backdrop)
•	Metis Settlements Land Registry Regulation (AR 361/91):
•	s.18 & s.20: Provisions for handling allocations and disputes (e.g., MSAT order to cancel, requirement to substantiate interests)[177][178]. (Policy 12 & 11 context)
•	s.29(1): Grounds Registrar may refuse to register – includes things like not in prescribed form, fees unpaid, etc. Notably (g) implies possible limitation but currently does not list land cap as ground[87]. (Policy 10 – gap identified)
•	s.30(1)(b): PMT expiry unless renewed by deadline[42]. (Policy 2 & 4)
•	s.30(1)(j): Cancellation of interests upon membership termination (ties to MSA s.95). (Policy 5)
•	s.30(2): Renewal of PMT within time, else expires[42]. (Policy 4)
•	s.57(1): Registrar can delegate certain powers in writing[174]. (Accountability – Deputy Registrar actions)
•	s.73(1)(a)(ii): Registrar must notify interest holder appears interest expired and will cancel if no objection in 60 days[5]. (Policy 2 & 3)
•	s.73(2): (presumably details on notice).
•	s.76: (From context in old policy, likely refers to membership records – e.g., MSA s.76(c) requiring members to maintain address[179]). Correction: likely MSA s.76 is about membership obligations.
•	MSGC Land Policy (current consolidated policy, effective circa 2015):
•	Section 3.4: Limits on Land Holdings – sets 175 acre base, one additional 167 acre parcel for farm/business, one hamlet lot, etc.. (Policy 10 enforcement)
•	Section 7.8: Estate Instructions – outlines that members can leave interests by instruction, likely conditions (like only to members, maybe approval by council). (Policy 9 aligns with this)
•	Section 8.2: Dispute referral to MSAT – any question on ownership or extent of interest can go to Tribunal[8][9]. (Policy 3 and 12 note this for objections/allocations)
•	Section 6.x: (Hypothetical) could be about allocations – likely says allocations are temporary and subject to renewal or cancellation. (Policy 12 mirrors this principle)
•	Section 5.x: (Hypothetical) membership land entitlement – perhaps something about one home lot rule. (Already covered in land cap and hamlet lot rule).
•	General: Land Policy requires Settlement Council approval for land transactions like transfers involving non-members (ensures only members hold) – MSLR ensures membership verification accordingly.
•	Surveys Act (Alberta):
•	Requirement that legal plans must be done by Alberta Land Surveyor (ALS) – (Policy 13, explicitly stated)[117][118].
•	Standards for monumentation and plan format which MSLR will adhere to (not cited in detail but forms context for Policy 13).
•	Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP, RSA 2000, c F-25):
•	Governs how personal info (like the Members List, addresses) can be collected, used, disclosed. Policy 6 and 16 align with FOIP by restricting access and securing data.
•	MSLR being a public body under FOIP means members can request their info; the policy proactively allows them access to their info. Also, any sharing of data (like with ARLO or PPR) must meet FOIP’s data sharing provisions – presumably handled in implementation agreements.
•	Examples of Court Cases:
•	Vicklund v. Peavine Metis Settlement (year) – established that immediate land cancellation on membership termination can be subject to fairness (Policy 5 cites respecting exceptions like this case). While internal, one might footnote that this case highlighted need for case-by-case exceptions.
•	ERCB/Industry etc. (if any cases about subsurface or utilities on Settlement land might have spurred noting easements on plans; but none specifically cited here).
These references provide the legal backbone and ensure that the Policy Book is not just operationally sound but legally grounded. All MSLR staff and relevant Settlement officials should be familiar with these key provisions to understand why the policies are as they are. Any future amendments to these sections should trigger a review of the Policy Book to keep alignment.

Modernized Metis Settlements Land Registry – Final Policy Integration and Implementation Package
Rationale and Legal Context
The Metis Settlements Land Registry (MSLR) requires a comprehensive modernization to address critical risks and fulfill legal mandates. Enterprise Risk Assessments have repeatedly flagged data integrity issues, outdated systems, and statutory compliance gaps in MSLR operations. For example, legacy database vulnerabilities and lack of disaster recovery have put sensitive land records at risk of corruption or loss[1][2]. The current registry system, largely unchanged since the 1990s, is not interoperable with modern tools and fails to meet today’s security standards[2]. This exposes the Registry to unauthorized access and technical failures, undermining the integrity of member and land data.
Equally pressing are legal and compliance deficiencies in past registry practices. Internal reviews revealed that the former Registrar misinterpreted key provisions of the Metis Settlements Act (MSA) and MSLR Regulation[3]. For years, MSLR’s procedures around expiring land interests deviated from statutory requirements. For instance, the Registry was sending 60-day cancellation warning letters by registered mail (though not legally required) and would abandon cancellation of expired interests if the letters came back unclaimed[4]. This inaction on uncancelled interests left “zombie” land interests on the books, a serious compliance gap that threatened the certainty of land title[5]. The new Policy Book directly tackles this by clarifying that notice by regular mail (with presumed delivery in 7 days under Alberta law) is sufficient to proceed with cancellation[4]. In another example, previous practice had MSLR rubber-stamping all Settlement Council requests to cancel Provisional Métis Titles (PMTs) without verifying that proper process was followed. This has been corrected to ensure cancellations only occur when a council’s denial of renewal meets regulatory conditions (i.e. backed by a council resolution and timely member application)[6]. Similarly, membership terminations were sometimes held “on pause” or handled informally, despite MSA’s clear mandate that when a member resigns or is removed, all their settlement land interests terminate after 10 days[7]. The Policy Book formalizes procedures to enforce these rules consistently, preventing backlogs and legal ambiguity.
Collectively, these high-risk issues—data vulnerabilities, antiquated processes, and non-compliant practices—present significant legal and operational exposure. The MSLR is the Minister’s delegated mechanism to maintain land and membership records for the Settlements, and it must uphold the trust placed in it by law. In fact, Section 98 of the MSA entrusts the Registrar with safeguarding the Settlement Members List and related records, meaning any lapse can violate privacy and statutory duties. Failing to modernize would perpetuate risks of incorrect land records, unenforced land caps, delayed transactions, and potential litigation from members whose rights are affected by inconsistent registry actions. The Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC) Land Policy and local Settlement bylaws also demand up-to-date implementation, which the old practices could not assure.
Operational necessity for modernization is equally compelling. An outdated, mostly paper-based registry has led to inefficiencies, manual errors, and poor service to Settlement members. Important transactions (e.g. land transfers, succession, or using land interests as collateral) are hampered by slow, unclear processes. Settlements have voiced concerns about lack of clarity in roles between local Land Clerks and MSLR, and members have faced frustration when rules are applied inconsistently. Modernizing to a digital, automated system with clear policies will improve turnaround times, transparency, and user access to their records. It also aligns MSLR with Alberta’s broader land titles modernization (“ARLO” system), ensuring compatibility and support from provincial infrastructure. Ultimately, a robust Policy Book and digital overhaul are legally required to meet MSA and regulatory obligations, and operationally critical to safeguard Métis settlement land rights for future generations. This initiative is a proactive measure to prevent identified risks—like data loss or unlawful registries—from materializing[1][8], and to instill confidence among stakeholders (members, councils, investors, and government) that the MSLR is reliable, up-to-date, and beyond legal reproach.
Final Modernized MSLR Policy Book (Consolidated 2025 Edition)
(Integrating MSA, MSLR Regulation, MSGC Land Policy, 2009–2014 Practice Directives, Digital Transformation Standards, and validated “MSLR Extra” interpretations.)
Table of Contents:
•	Foundational Principles
•	Policy 1 – Partial Interests: Recording & Subdivision Approval
•	Policy 2 – Sending 60-Day Expiry Notice Letters
•	Policy 3 – Objections to Cancellations of Interests
•	Policy 4 – Renewal and Cancellation of Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and Allotment Interests
•	Policy 5 – Termination of Membership and Termination of Land Interests
•	Policy 6 – Access to the Settlement Members List
•	Policy 7 – Incomplete Submissions
•	Policy 8 – Digital Maps and Plans
•	Policy 9 – Estate Instructions
•	Policy 10 – Limits on Member Land Holdings
•	Policy 11 – Interests on Unsurveyed Land
•	Policy 12 – Allocation Interests
•	Policy 13 – Survey Plan Requirements
•	Policy 14 – Document Alterations and Corrections
•	Policy 15 – MSLR Counter Service
•	Policy 16 – Digital Portal Access and Security
Foundational Principles
•	Legal Supremacy: All MSLR functions must comply with governing legislation – the Metis Settlements Act (MSA), Metis Settlements Land Registry Regulation, MSGC Land Policy, the Surveys Act, privacy laws, and any relevant Settlement bylaws. Where any conflict arises, statutory requirements prevail.
•	Digital-First, Paper-Permitted: Every transaction should be completed through the new MSLR Digital Portal for efficiency and tracking. Paper submissions are accepted only if a client lacks reliable digital access or if an original physical document is legally required (e.g. original wills for estate instructions). In all cases, digital records will be created for any paper submissions.
•	Role-Based Access & Auditability: System access is restricted by user role in accordance with MSA s.98 (e.g. only authorized persons can view the Members List). Every view, submission, edit, or approval is logged. Audit trails are immutable, ensuring transparency and accountability for all registry activities.
•	Automation of Rules: Wherever possible, statutory and policy rules are encoded into the system. This includes automatic checks on land interest acreage caps, required subdivision approval, interest expiry dates, member status validity, and document completeness. Automated enforcement eliminates ad hoc discretion in routine compliance matters while respecting legal limits (e.g. flagging but not rejecting transactions that exceed current legal authority per Policy 10).
•	Inter-Governmental Interoperability: The MSLR system securely interfaces with external systems for seamless operations. For example, it connects to Alberta’s ARLO land titles platform for parcel mapping and coordinate validation, to Indigenous Services Canada’s Indian Register (for Section 90 MSA membership checks), and to the Alberta Personal Property Registry if needed for registering charges or liens that cross over with personal property.
•	User-Centered Service: The registry’s services are designed with end-users in mind. Settlement members, Settlement councils, MSGC, land surveyors, and provincial administrators all have tailored portal dashboards. Guided e-forms and real-time status tracking are available. A built-in Help Center (with a knowledge base, chatbot, and tutorial videos) ensures that users can get assistance, thereby bridging any digital literacy gaps among community members.
•	Data Sovereignty & Security: All MSLR data is stored on servers located in Alberta, under GoA (Government of Alberta) custody, respecting Métis data sovereignty. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Real-time replication to a secondary government data center is in place to guard against data loss or corruption, addressing risks identified in past audits. Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to maintain system integrity.
Policy 1 – Partial Interests: Recording & Subdivision Approval
Date of Original Approval: April 14, 2005
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Historically, MSLR recorded partial interests in Settlement land (for example, when a member sold or gifted part of their land interest) even before a formal subdivision of that land was approved. This led to “fragmented” interests on one parcel, creating legal uncertainty. Section 106 of the MSA now clearly requires Settlement Council subdivision approval before any partial interest can be registered. This policy aligns Registry practice with that statutory requirement and prevents premature fragmentation of Settlement land interests.
Policy Statements:
- Subdivision Prerequisite: MSLR shall not record or register any transfer of a partial interest in a Settlement land holding unless the submission includes an approved subdivision plan for the subject land, duly authorized by the Settlement Council. In practical terms, the land parcel must be subdivided (or subdivision approval granted) before part of it can be transferred to another party.
- Rejecting Unapproved Subdivisions: Any transfer requests involving only a portion of a land interest without an accompanying council-approved survey plan will be rejected. MSLR will return the submission with a deficiency notice (see Policy 7 on handling incomplete or non-compliant requests). The applicant will be advised to obtain subdivision approval and reapply.
- Legacy Cases: Partial interests that were historically registered without formal subdivision (prior to this policy) are grandfathered to preserve stability – they remain on the registry. However, such entries will be flagged in the system for future follow-up. Settlement Councils will be encouraged to formally subdivide these parcels where feasible, to align all records with legal parcels.
Implementation:
- MSLR staff processing a partial interest transfer must verify that a Subdivision Approval (usually a Council Resolution and plan number) is attached. Staff will cross-check with the Settlement’s Land Clerk or planning office if needed.
- The Digital Portal will require an upload of the approved subdivision plan (in digital format) when someone attempts to transfer a partial interest. The system will automatically validate the plan’s authenticity (e.g. ensuring it’s signed by an Alberta Land Surveyor and references the correct land). It will also integrate with the ARLO parcel fabric to ensure the new parcels are mapped accurately.
- Settlement Land Clerks should work closely with members to facilitate council subdivision approvals before members submit transfer documents to MSLR. This may include helping the member get a survey done and a council motion passed in a timely way. The portal’s dashboard will show clerks any pending partial transfer submissions so they can follow up on missing subdivision approvals.
Impacts:
- Legal Compliance: Enforces section 106 MSA, ensuring no land interest is divided in the registry without proper authority[9]. This protects the integrity of land titles on Settlements and avoids future disputes over unofficial lot splits.
- Land Management: Prevents uncontrolled fragmentation of Settlement lands, supporting Settlement Councils’ ability to manage land use and development coherently.
- Efficiency: While requiring upfront subdivision approval adds a step, it ultimately reduces confusion and potential unwinding of improper transactions. Digital integration should make it straightforward to attach and verify plans, though some training will be needed for users unfamiliar with the process. MSLR will provide guidance (via the Portal help and training sessions) to ensure members and councils understand this requirement, minimizing any slowdowns.
Policy 2 – Sending 60-Day Expiry Notice Letters
Date of Original Approval: September 26, 2006
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Under MSLR Regulation sections 30(1)(b), 30(2) and 73(1)(a)(ii), a registered Provisional Métis Title (PMT) or Allotment expires after its term unless renewed within the prescribed time. The law directs the Registrar to notify the holder that their interest appears to have expired and will be cancelled if not renewed or if no objection is received within 60 days[10]. In the past, notice practices were inconsistent. The Registry used to send “60-day expiry letters” by registered mail and would often take no action if the letter was not claimed by the member[4], leading to interests lingering past expiry. This policy standardizes the notification method and timeline, improving clarity and compliance.
Policy Statements:
- Mandatory Expiry Notices: MSLR will issue a written notice of pending expiry for every PMT or Allotment set to expire, at least 60 days before the expiry date. The notice informs the holder of the exact expiry date, the steps to renew (or convert to Métis Title), applicable fees, and the consequence of non-renewal (cancellation of the interest).
- Delivery Method: Notices will be sent via regular mail to the holder’s last known mailing address on file, and via digital notification (email or portal alert) for those members who have opted into electronic communications. (Rationale: Regular mail fulfills legal notice requirements by presuming delivery within 7 days[11], while digital delivery provides faster, additional assurance.) Registered mail will no longer be used for these notices, as it is not legally required and proved ineffective in the past[4]. However, copies of each notice will also be forwarded to the respective Settlement Office (Land Clerk) to help track down members if needed.
- Content of Notice: The 60-day notice letter will clearly state that the member has 60 days from the date of the letter (which equals the date of mailing) to object or to prove renewal, in line with Reg. 73(1)(a)(ii). It will highlight any known valid grounds for objection or special instructions (for example, if the member believes they applied for renewal on time or there’s an error, they should file an objection – see Policy 3). It will also provide MSLR contact information for questions.
- Renewal Opportunity: If a member receives a 60-day notice and still wishes to keep the land, they are encouraged to immediately contact their Settlement Council to submit a renewal application (if not already done). The notice will note that renewals must have been submitted before the original expiry date to be considered (per Policy 4), so if the expiry date has already passed by the time they receive the notice (which might happen if something was delayed), their recourse is likely through an objection or appeal rather than a late renewal.
Implementation:
- The MSLR Digital Portal will automatically generate pending-expiry notifications 90 days in advance of each PMT/Allotment expiry (as a preliminary reminder), giving additional buffer time. At 60 days prior, the system will generate the official notice letter. Portal users (members who have accounts) will get an electronic alert, and a physical letter template will be produced for mailing.
- MSLR staff will ensure the letter is mailed out promptly on the date it’s dated. The system will log the mailing date. If, for any reason, mailing is delayed, staff must update the letter’s date to match the actual send date (so that the 60-day response window is always calculated from the mailing date)[12]. The Portal’s tracking module will mark the countdown of 60 days and flag the interest for cancellation if no action is taken by expiry + 60 days.
- Settlement Land Clerks receiving copies should attempt to contact members locally (e.g., by a phone call or in-person) especially if mail reliability is a concern. Clerks can help ensure the member understands the notice and assist in submitting any renewal or objection in a timely manner.
- MSLR will maintain a log of all notices sent, with dates, to show compliance with notice obligations. This log will be auditable to demonstrate that no interest is canceled without the required notice being given.
Impacts:
- Member Awareness: By using multiple channels (mail + digital + local offices), this policy greatly increases the likelihood that members are informed of impending expiries. This should reduce the number of unintended lapses of land interests.
- Consistency and Fairness: Standardizing the notice procedure and timeline ensures every member gets the same opportunity (60 days) to respond. It removes past uncertainty – no more cases where an interest remains in limbo because a registered letter went unclaimed. Now, if no objection is heard within 60 days of sending notice, the interest will be canceled as required.
- Administrative Efficiency: Relying on the legal presumption of mail delivery[11] streamlines the process – MSLR no longer has to track return receipts or re-send letters. The integration with digital reminders (90-day reminders, portal alerts) aligns with modern e-government practices (similar to ARLO’s notification system) and helps mitigate any mail delays. There may be a need for member education on checking emails/portal, but with Settlement support, this dual approach addresses both traditional and modern communication preferences.
Policy 3 – Objections to Cancellations of Interests
Date of Original Approval: August 26, 2005
Last Updated: November 22, 2006; July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: The MSLR Regulation provides that if the Registrar intends to cancel a land interest (for example, an expired PMT), the interest holder has a right to object to the cancellation within a specified period (60 days from notice, per s.73(1)(a)(ii) of the Regulation). Additionally, even beyond that specific scenario, principles of administrative fairness allow members to challenge registry decisions that affect their rights. In the past, there was no formal internal process at MSLR for handling objections – members had to appeal directly to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) or court, and the Registry’s practice was ad hoc. This policy establishes a clear, fair procedure for lodging and resolving objections, ensuring members’ rights to be heard are respected before final cancellation.
Policy Statements:
- Right to Object: A holder of a Settlement land interest may submit a written Objection to MSLR against a proposed cancellation of their interest, within 60 days after the cancellation notice was sent (or within any other period specified by law or by the notice). Objections could relate to PMT expiries, or other interest cancellations (e.g. cancellations due to membership termination, etc.).
- Form and Grounds: An Objection must be in writing (including digital submissions via the Portal) and should state the grounds for objecting. Acceptable grounds include any reason that, if valid, would make the cancellation improper – for example: MSLR error (clerical or in calculation of expiry), lack of proper notice, the member did in fact submit a renewal or required document on time, Council or MSLR did not follow required procedure, or other equitable factors (like an illness prevented response). The objector should provide any supporting evidence available (receipts, copies of applications, correspondence, etc.). MSLR will not reject an objection for lack of formality, but clearly articulated grounds help resolution.
- Stay of Cancellation: Upon receiving a timely objection, MSLR will suspend the cancellation action for that interest. This means the interest will not be removed or otherwise disturbed until the objection is resolved through the steps below. If an objection arrives after the 60-day window and the interest has already been canceled, MSLR may treat it as an appeal request (redirecting the member to MSAT), since the statutory window lapsed.
- Internal Review Process: The MSLR Registrar (or a delegated senior staff member not involved in the original cancellation decision) will review the objection within 15 business days of receipt. This review includes examining the registry files, any new evidence from the objector, and relevant law/policies. The Registrar may also consult with the Settlement Council or MSAT for context if needed.
- Decision and Communication: After review, the Registrar will make a determination to either: (a) Uphold the Objection (meaning the interest will not be canceled, or if already canceled in error, it will be reinstated) – typically if a valid renewal was made or a clear mistake occurred; (b) Dismiss the Objection (proceed with cancellation) – if the interest truly expired and no procedural error is found; or (c) Refer the matter to MSAT – if the issue raised is complex or involves judgment beyond registry scope (for instance, disputes about whether council properly denied a renewal, or fairness considerations). The decision will be given in writing to the objector, with reasons.
- Appeal: If the objector is unsatisfied with MSLR’s decision, they retain the right to appeal to the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal as provided by the MSA. The MSLR’s decision letter will inform them of this right and the timeframe (usually 30 days from the decision) to file an MSAT appeal. In certain cases, MSLR itself may proactively refer the objection to MSAT immediately (especially if it clearly falls under MSAT’s jurisdiction to decide questions of “ownership or extent of an interest” per MSGC Land Policy s.8.2). In those cases, the member will be notified that their objection was forwarded to MSAT for a hearing[13].
Implementation:
- The MSLR Digital Portal will include an “Objection Form” that guides users to input necessary information (their interest details, reason for objection, etc.) and attach any supporting files. This will make it easier for members to submit within the deadline. A printable PDF form will also be available for those who prefer paper (and Settlement offices can help a member fill it out and scan it to MSLR).
- When an objection is submitted, the system will log the date/time and flag the relevant land interest record as “Under Objection – Hold Cancellation.” MSLR staff will be alerted immediately. All processing on that interest stops until resolution.
- An MSLR Registrar delegate will use a standardized Objection Review Checklist to ensure all relevant factors are considered (e.g. Was notice sent properly? Did the member attempt renewal? Did council meet its obligations – like consider renewal application within 45 days as required by MSGC policy? Are the grounds something MSAT should rule on?). If additional information is needed, the Registrar may contact the objector or Settlement for clarification within the 15-day review window.
- The outcome (internal decision or referral to MSAT) will be recorded in the system and communicated to the member in writing. If the objection is upheld internally, MSLR will take corrective action (e.g. reverse a cancellation, or extend a deadline as appropriate) and inform the Settlement Council if needed. If dismissed, the cancellation proceeds immediately after the decision (subject to appeal rights). For any referrals to MSAT, MSLR will package all relevant records and send them to MSAT within a further 5 business days, to expedite the Tribunal’s handling.
- All objection submissions and resolutions will be retained in an Objections Register for audit purposes. This will help track patterns (for example, if many objections stem from a particular Settlement’s delay in processing renewals, that can be flagged as a systemic issue).
Impacts:
- Member Rights Protected: This formal objection process gives members a clear avenue to be heard before losing their land interests. It upholds procedural fairness and the audi alteram partem principle (no one should be adversely affected without an opportunity to respond). Members no longer have to immediately resort to legal appeals; there is a chance for quick, amicable resolution at the Registry level.
- Transparency and Trust: By documenting objections and decisions, MSLR increases transparency. Members will see reasons in writing, which builds trust that decisions aren’t arbitrary. The availability of MSAT appeal ensures independent oversight, which reinforces confidence in the process.
- Operational Clarity: Registry staff now have a clear playbook for handling objections, replacing any past ad hoc or hesitant approaches. The timeline (15 business days for decision) ensures objections don’t languish indefinitely, which also means that valid interests aren’t stuck in limbo too long. Digital tracking of objections will help management monitor how many objections are occurring and why, enabling continuous improvement (for instance, if many objections cite lack of notice, perhaps the notice process needs further improvement).
- Consistency with Wider Framework: This process dovetails with MSAT’s role and the MSGC Land Policy clause that questions of ownership/interest extent may be referred to MSAT[14][15]. The policy essentially operationalizes that clause by referring objections that raise such questions directly to MSAT rather than forcing members to figure it out on their own. This likely results in faster resolutions and less burden on members, while ensuring the appropriate body (MSLR vs MSAT) handles each issue.
Policy 4 – Renewal and Cancellation of Provisional Métis Title (PMT) and Allotment Interests
Date of Original Approval: November 22, 2006
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Provisional Métis Titles (PMTs) and certain Allotments are time-limited Settlement land interests. According to MSLR Regulation 30(1)(b) and 30(2), a PMT will expire at the end of its term unless it is successfully renewed in accordance with the law (typically before the expiry date and upon meeting any conditions like fees). In the past, inconsistent handling of late renewals or unclear instructions from Settlement Councils led to confusion – sometimes expired interests were left active due to leniency, or conversely, canceled even when a renewal was attempted. This policy reinforces strict adherence to deadlines for renewals and clarifies MSLR’s response to expired interests, aligning with the regulatory framework and MSGC Land Policy on renewals. It also integrates an important practice directive to ensure Settlement Council-initiated cancellations follow proper procedure (preventing arbitrary removals).
Policy Statements:
- Renewal Application Timing: Only renewal applications submitted before the PMT or Allotment’s expiry date will be accepted and processed. In other words, the interest holder must have applied for renewal (or for a patent Métis Title, if converting) by the last day of their current term. Any application received even one day after the expiry is considered late and invalid.
- Late/Expired Cases: Renewal applications received after the expiry date shall be rejected by MSLR. Once the term has expired without a timely renewal, the interest holder loses the automatic right of renewal. The proper course in such cases would be a new application for a fresh interest (if possible) or an appeal if there are extenuating circumstances (see Policy 3 – an objection could be lodged if the member believes a late application should be excused due to an error, but otherwise late = no renewal).
- Complete Applications Only: Even if submitted on time, a renewal application must be complete (all required information, documents, and fees included) to be processed. Incomplete or deficient renewal submissions will be handled per Policy 7 – they are not considered “received” for the purposes of beating the expiry deadline. MSLR will promptly notify the applicant of deficiencies, but if they fail to correct them by expiry, the renewal will not be granted.
- Renewal Processing: All timely, complete renewal applications with the appropriate renewal fee (and any other requirements, like evidence of land use if required by policy) will be processed by MSLR immediately upon receipt. “Processed” means MSLR will update the registry to extend the interest term (or issue a new Métis Title if it’s a conversion), and provide confirmation to the member and Settlement Council. If any Settlement Council approval is needed (depending on MSGC Land Policy requirements for renewals or conversions), that should be indicated on the application form; MSLR will verify such approval is attached before finalizing.
- Automatic Cancellation upon Expiry: If a PMT/Allotment expires with no renewal in place, MSLR will cancel the interest effective the day after the expiry date. In practice, the system will be set to automatically mark an expired interest as “canceled” when its term lapses and no renewal record is entered. The Registrar will send a confirmation of cancellation to the former holder and the Settlement (separate from the 60-day notice which was already provided beforehand under Policy 2). This ensures the registry reflects the current reality – that land reverts to the Settlement (or as per MSA, becomes available for re-allotment).
- Council-Requested Cancellations: (Per MSLR Regulation 30(1)(a)) If a Settlement Council has decided not to renew a PMT (or not to grant Métis Title upon its expiry) despite a member’s timely application, the Council may submit a cancellation request (Form MSLR-07) to the Registry. MSLR will only act on such a request if it is accompanied by: (1) a certified Council resolution explicitly denying the renewal or patent for that PMT, and (2) a copy of the member’s renewal (or Métis Title) application that was submitted before the original expiry date[16]. These documents ensure that the cancellation is procedurally proper (the member tried to renew on time, and the elected Council made a decision). Upon receipt of a valid request package, MSLR will cancel the interest as requested (or if the expiry date has not yet arrived, flag it for cancellation at expiry). If these supporting documents are not provided, MSLR will return the request as incomplete, since canceling a PMT without giving the member an opportunity to apply or without formal Council record would violate due process.
Implementation:
- The Digital Portal will enforce the renewal deadline automatically: after the expiry date passes, the portal will no longer allow that interest’s renewal to be submitted. A notice on the screen will inform the user that the interest has expired and direct them to contact the Settlement or MSLR if they believe there are special circumstances. This prevents late filings from slipping through.
- For tracking purposes, 30 days before any PMT expiry, the system will check if a renewal application has been filed. If not, it will send an alert to the member (if online) reminding them of the approaching deadline (this complements the 60-day formal letter). It will also notify the Settlement Land Clerk to possibly remind the member locally.
- MSLR staff, upon receiving a renewal application (either via the portal or on paper), will immediately stamp it with the date/time. They will review it for completeness: if something is missing, staff will contact the member and the Settlement office at once to get the missing info. The Policy 7 (Incomplete) standards apply – incomplete submissions are effectively not accepted, but every effort will be made to rectify deficiencies before the expiry if time allows. Staff should maintain a checklist for renewal requirements to expedite this.
- If a Settlement Council submits a PMT cancellation request (MSLR-07 form due to Council denying renewal), MSLR staff must verify the required attachments: the Council resolution number and date, and a copy of the member’s original renewal application. The registry record for that interest will then be updated: marked as “Pending Cancellation – Council Decision” until the expiry date. On the expiry date (or immediately if expiry has passed), the Registrar will finalize cancellation and record a note referencing the council resolution. If an objection is subsequently filed by the member (likely appealing Council’s denial), Policy 3 would come into play – in such a case, MSLR would refer the matter to MSAT as a dispute over the Council’s decision, since MSLR itself is bound by the Council’s call.
- After any cancellation (whether automatic due to no renewal or via council request), MSLR will generate a Cancellation Notice documenting the reason (expiry no renewal, or council non-renewal) and update the land status. The Settlement Council gets a copy to know the land is free for re-allocation.
- Training will be provided to Settlement councils on these rules, emphasizing that if they choose not to renew someone’s interest even when the person applied on time, they must pass a resolution and inform MSLR properly. Likewise, members will be educated via info sessions or the guidebook (see Guidebook) about their responsibility to apply before expiry – “If you miss the deadline, you lose the land.”
Impacts:
- Clarity and Predictability: Members now have absolute clarity: Submit renewal before expiry or lose the interest. This might seem strict, but it is what the law intended and prevents false hope or lobbying after the fact. It also encourages proactive land management; members will likely be more mindful of their term dates.
- Compliance with Law: This policy corrects the previous lax enforcement and aligns with MSLR Regulation requirements. By disallowing post-expiry renewals, it closes a compliance gap. The incorporation of the Council-request provision ensures MSLR doesn’t cancel a PMT at a Council’s behest unless the proper procedure was followed (member applied, council denied)[16]. This guards against any arbitrary or politically motivated cancellations outside the rules.
- Reduction of Backlogs: Earlier, if renewals were taken late or lingered, it created a backlog of “maybe expired, maybe not” interests. Now the registry will be current – an interest is either renewed on time or removed. This up-to-date status helps Settlement planning and avoids confusion (e.g., no more carrying expired interests on the books hoping for retroactive fixes).
- Appeal Safeguard: Members who feel aggrieved (for instance, if Council unfairly denied their timely renewal) have recourse via objections and MSAT. The policy funnels such disputes to the proper forum (MSAT) rather than muddying the registry’s role. This separation of duties means MSLR focuses on administrative correctness, while MSAT or political bodies handle fairness of council decisions.
- Digital Enablement: The automation of deadlines and rejections in the portal eliminates human error (no forgetting to check a date). However, it relies on data accuracy (the system must have the correct expiry dates for each interest). Part of implementation will involve auditing the database to ensure all interest expiry dates are correctly recorded so that no erroneous early or late cancellations occur. That audit is included in the implementation plan.
Policy 5 – Termination of Membership and Termination of Land Interests
Date of Original Approval: February 16, 2005
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Under the Metis Settlements Act, Settlement membership is a prerequisite for holding Settlement land interests. If an individual’s membership is terminated (whether voluntarily resigned or by expulsion or other operation of law), all their land interests in Settlement land terminate automatically (MSA s.90 and s.91 outline these effects). In practice, however, MSLR encountered situations where membership terminations were not processed cleanly. Some members submitted resignation letters with conditions or future effective dates, causing confusion. In other cases, Settlements forwarded membership terminations to MSLR very late or incomplete, leading to a backlog of “half-processed” terminations. Additionally, a specific case (Vicklund vs. Peavine Settlement) highlighted that exceptions or delays in canceling land might occur due to fairness or legal challenges. This policy ensures a streamlined, standardized approach: when membership ends, land interests are dealt with promptly, while allowing for any exceptional circumstances to be considered through proper channels.
Policy Statements:
- Existing “On Hold” Files: For any membership termination cases that are currently in limbo or on hold at MSLR (e.g., a member’s resignation that was received but held pending some condition, or an expulsion that is under appeal), MSLR will close those pending files and return them to the sender (whether it was the member or the Settlement). Specifically, if MSLR has a member’s resignation letter on file that didn’t go through the proper process, or partial documentation of a termination, those will be sent back to the Settlement Council or originator with instructions to re-submit properly when ready. The affected member will be copied on this communication so they know the status. This effectively “clears the deck” of any unofficial holds.
- No Conditional Terminations: MSLR will not accept membership termination requests that are conditional or delayed for an unspecified future event. For example, if a member writes “I want to resign my membership but only after I sell my house” or a Settlement says “We won’t finalize this expulsion until the member does X,” such scenarios are not recognized by the Registry. The process must either proceed or not occur. Any termination document containing conditions or asking MSLR to “hold off” will be returned, advising that it be re-submitted when it’s truly ready to process[17][18]. MSLR’s role is to process terminations as per the Act, not to manage side arrangements.
- Immediate Processing of New Terminations: Going forward, whenever MSLR receives a complete notification of membership termination, it will process it immediately. “Complete” means: in the case of a voluntary resignation, the letter from the member has been properly routed (first given to the Settlement, which then forwards a copy to the Registrar as required by MSA s.89.1) – we should have the Settlement’s cover letter or stamp indicating the 10-day period passed; in the case of a council-driven termination (expulsion), we have the MSAT order or Council minutes and the effective date. As soon as these are in hand, the Registrar will update the Settlement Members List to remove the individual as an active member and concurrently update the Land Registry.
- Land Interest Cancellation: Upon a member’s termination of membership, all of that person’s Settlement land interests are terminated by operation of law (MSA s.90). MSLR will carry this out by canceling or transferring those interests as appropriate. Specifically, if the member was the sole holder of an interest, that interest is canceled from the registry (the land becomes Settlement land available for re-allocation, often reverting to the Settlement’s name in interim). If the member held an interest jointly with others, their name is removed and the interest may vest in the remaining joint holder(s) or as directed by law. The cancellation of land interests will occur effective the membership termination date (10 days after resignation letter received by Settlement, or date of expulsion order, etc.), without further notice to the former member (since the Act itself provides notice enough of this consequence[7]). However, MSLR will notify the Settlement Council and any co-holders of the land that the change has occurred.
- Exceptional Cases: If there is a legal stay or court/Tribunal order that affects the termination (for example, a court orders that a member’s land interest not be disturbed pending an appeal of their membership termination, as might have been an issue in Vicklund vs. Peavine), MSLR will comply with that order. These are rare, but the policy allows that exceptions can be made in extraordinary circumstances where proceeding immediately would violate a higher authority or fairness principle. In such cases, the Registrar will document the reason for delaying land cancellation (e.g., “Per MSAT Interim Order dated X, land interest retention pending appeal outcome”). Absent such explicit directive, the default is immediate termination as above.
Implementation:
- Audit of Pending Files: MSLR will conduct an audit of all membership termination-related files. Any file that has sat inactive (e.g., a member resignation received directly but not via Settlement, or an incomplete expulsion where documents are missing) will be identified. For each, a form letter will be prepared to send to the appropriate party (Settlement Council, MSAT, or member) explaining that MSLR cannot finalize the termination until proper process is followed, and thus the file is closed for now. This one-time clean-up will remove uncertainty.
- Process Alignment with Settlements: MSLR will communicate with all Settlement Councils to reiterate the proper process: A member’s resignation must be delivered to the Settlement, who waits 10 days, then forwards to MSLR[19][20]; A member’s expulsion must be decided by Council and MSAT (if appealed), then sent to MSLR with effective date. We will provide checklists to Settlement Administrations on what to include when they send a termination to MSLR (e.g., for a voluntary, include the date received and a statement that 10 days passed with no retraction; for an expulsion, include confirmation that appeal windows passed or outcome of appeal). This will ensure that when MSLR gets a package, it’s ready to go.
- Immediate Updates: MSLR staff will be trained to treat membership terminations with high priority. As soon as a termination notice lands, staff will verify completeness and then simultaneously update: (a) the Settlement Members List (mark the member as terminated on the effective date, with a reason code and reference to the source document), and (b) the Land Registry (cancel all interests of that member effective that date). The digital system will have functionality to automatically link these – e.g., when a member’s status is changed to “Terminated” in the database, the system will prompt: “Cancel all interests held by this member? Y/N” for confirmation, then execute it in one step.
- Notification: After processing, MSLR will send out notifications: a letter (or email via portal) to the now former member (if reachable) confirming their membership is terminated and consequently their land interests are gone, referencing the MSA provisions. Also, notification to the relevant Settlement Council confirming completion, and to any joint interest holders or registered interest holders (like mortgagees) as needed that the interest has been affected by membership loss. This ensures all stakeholders are aware of the change and can take any next steps (Settlements can re-allot land, etc.).
- Exceptional Handling: MSLR’s system will include a flag function for any membership termination case where a legal hold is in place. For instance, if MSAT or a court issues a stay on land cancellation, staff can mark that member in the system as “Do Not Auto-Cancel Interests – Legal Hold”. A brief note citing the order will be attached. Management will periodically review such holds. If the hold is lifted or the appeal resolved, staff will then promptly finalize the cancellations. This way no case falls through the cracks. We will coordinate with MSAT to receive timely info on appeals so that we know when not to proceed.
Impacts:
- Reduced Backlog and Clarity: The historical backlog of quasi-terminated memberships (some files pending for years) will be eliminated. Going forward, every membership change will be reflected in the records promptly. This clarity ensures that no one mistakenly conducts business with someone who is no longer a member (e.g., attempting to buy land from someone who technically lost membership – such scenarios should vanish).
- Legal Soundness: The policy enforces exactly what the MSA stipulates – land rights cease with membership. By not indulging conditional resignations or indefinite delays, it avoids creating unauthorized exceptions that could be legally problematic. At the same time, by acknowledging court/Tribunal interventions, it respects due process in those rare situations. Overall, this strikes a balance between automatic rule and fairness.
- Efficiency and Fairness to Members: Members who do choose to resign will have their matters handled quickly – they won’t be left waiting in uncertainty about whether they’re “out” or not. If someone changes their mind within the 10 days, they can revoke at the Settlement (as law allows), but otherwise things move on. For those being expelled, once the appeals (if any) are over, they too aren’t left in limbo; the land gets sorted out, which might even help them (e.g., if they had a mortgage it can be resolved via settlement paying it out or etc.).
- Administrative Burden: There is a bit of increased work upfront for MSLR staff to carefully double-check termination submissions for completeness (ensuring all steps were followed). But this is offset by the removal of perpetual pending files. Digital automation of linking membership status with land interests will significantly cut down manual work and errors.
- Community Perspective: Settlement Councils will appreciate having old cases resolved and knowing that when they forward something to MSLR it will be done immediately (so they can proceed to reassign lands or update local records accordingly). Members will benefit from the consistency – no special deals or delays for some and not others; everyone is treated the same under the rules.
Policy 6 – Access to the Settlement Members List
Date of Original Approval: March 10, 2005
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: The Settlement Members List is a registry of all current Settlement members, maintained by MSLR as per MSA Section 98. This information is sensitive (contains personal data) and is legally protected – only certain people may access it, and only for certain purposes. In the past, controls around who could get this list or information from it were not always strict, risking privacy breaches. For example, there were instances of non-authorized individuals requesting verification of someone’s membership and being improperly given information. With digital records, the potential risk of broad exposure is even higher if not managed properly. This policy reiterates who can access membership information and how, ensuring privacy and compliance with the MSA and Alberta’s privacy legislation (FOIP or equivalent).
Policy Statements:
- Authorized Persons Only: Access to view or obtain information from the Settlement Members List is limited to the following, as authorized by law:
1. Settlement Councils and their authorized administrative staff – they need this info for governance and service delivery at the local level.
2. Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC) and authorized MSGC staff – as the central governing body, for oversight or policy purposes.
3. Provincial Government officials who have a direct regulatory or legal need (e.g., staff of Indigenous Relations or other Ministries responsible for Metis Settlements who may need to verify membership status for programs, or officials ensuring compliance with membership provisions of MSA).
4. Legal representatives of a member, but only with the member’s consent or via a court order – e.g., a lawyer requesting confirmation of a client’s membership for an estate or a land transaction. Proper documentation (like a consent form or power of attorney) is required.
5. The individual member themselves – any person can access their own listing and associated details (e.g., to confirm what info is on file, such as their recorded address or membership dates).
(Any access outside these categories, such as researchers or extended family, is not permitted without a specific legal mandate.)
- Purpose Limitation: Even those authorized above must access the Members List only for legitimate purposes related to their role. For example, a Settlement Council member may check the list to confirm someone’s membership in order to approve a land transaction, but should not be browsing the list out of curiosity or for unrelated matters. Any request for information must specify a purpose (which will be logged). Using membership data for purposes contrary to privacy laws (like marketing, or personal use) is prohibited.
- Access Mechanism: Access will be provided primarily through the MSLR Digital Portal’s role-based system. Authorized users (Council, MSGC, gov’t) will have secure logins that grant them read-only access to the Members List or the portion relevant to them (e.g., a particular Settlement’s list for that Settlement’s clerk). Individual members can access their own profile via a personal login. Any offline requests (e.g., a letter from a lawyer with member consent) will be processed by MSLR staff who will provide a certified excerpt of the list for that member only.
- Confidentiality and Security: The data in the Members List is classified as confidential personal information. Those accessing it must ensure it is not shared further without authorization. Screens in the portal will mask certain sensitive fields by default (like birth dates) unless needed. Any downloads of the list (e.g., by MSGC for election purposes or by IR Ministry for official use) must be approved by the Registrar and logged. Hard copies, if printed, should be kept secure and shredded when no longer needed.
- Audit of Access: All access to the Members List will be logged (user, date/time, data viewed). MSLR will conduct periodic audits of these logs. If any misuse is detected (e.g., someone accessing records without proper reason), the Registrar will revoke access and report the incident to the appropriate authority (which could involve discipline under employment rules or even charges under privacy laws if egregious).
Implementation:
- Digital Controls: In configuring the new Digital Portal, the IT developers will implement a role-based permission matrix. For example, a Settlement Clerk login might allow viewing and searching members of their own Settlement only, while an MSGC admin might view all Settlements but not download in bulk, etc. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for anyone with access to such sensitive data[21], to prevent unauthorized logins.
- User Agreements: Every authorized user will be required to sign a User Agreement acknowledging the terms of access (who they can share info with, that they will only use it for work purposes, etc.), and acknowledging that breaches may lead to revocation and possible legal consequences. The portal login will display a reminder of these terms (“You are accessing confidential information – authorized use only”).
- Member Verification: When members access their own information via the portal, they will undergo identity verification (e.g., using their secure login which is tied to their personal identity and possibly a one-time verification code sent when they register). If a member requests their info by mail or phone, MSLR will have a procedure to verify identity (such as notarized request or personal security questions).
- Education: MSLR will provide training to Settlement and MSGC staff on what the appropriate uses of the Members List are. Also, privacy briefings will be held – possibly inviting the Ministry’s Privacy Officer to emphasize the importance of safeguarding personal data.
- FOIP Coordination: MSLR will update its FOIP (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) registry of personal information banks to include the digital Members List system, and have in place protocols for any FOIP requests. Generally, FOIP would not allow release of this list except under the authorized categories, which we’ve mirrored in policy. If a FOIP request or subpoena does come for membership data, MSLR will consult with legal counsel to handle it appropriately.
Impacts:
- Privacy Protection: Strictly limiting access protects members’ personal information (addresses, membership status, etc.) from misuse. This mitigates risks of identity theft, harassment, or political misuse of the list. Members can feel secure that their data isn’t open to just anyone.
- Operational Needs Met: At the same time, those who truly need the information (e.g., a Settlement needs to know who its members are for voting or land allocation) have a clear path to get it. The policy doesn’t unduly hinder necessary operations; it just wraps them in proper controls. For instance, a clerk can still verify membership for a land transfer immediately via the portal, which is faster than the old method of phoning MSLR.
- Accountability: The logging and audit measures mean that any breach can be traced. This accountability will discourage would-be snoopers. It also builds trust with external stakeholders (e.g., the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner) that MSLR is handling personal data responsibly, which is crucial as we modernize digitally.
- Consistent with MSA: MSA s.98 essentially restricts the Members List access to “authorized persons” – this policy puts that into practice definitively. It also aligns with Alberta’s push for data security in government systems. By mirroring some of ARLO’s security standards (MFA, audit logs)[22][23], we ensure our system is on par with the provincial land titles system in terms of protecting stakeholder information.
Policy 7 – Incomplete Requests to MSLR
Date of Original Approval: October 1, 2009
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Prior to 2009, MSLR often received incomplete or incorrect submissions for land or membership transactions (missing signatures, wrong legal land descriptions, omitted required forms like spousal consents, etc.). The practice was to hold these in a pending file and go back-and-forth with the applicant or Settlement until the information was completed. This led to inefficiencies, backlogs of files sitting for months, and sometimes disputes about whether something was “received” by a deadline. In 2009, a directive was introduced to stop that practice – instead, to reject incomplete packages upfront. This policy reiterates that stance and updates it for the digital era. The goal is to enforce diligence in submissions and ensure MSLR processes only proper, ready-to-register documents.
Policy Statements:
- No Processing of Incomplete Submissions: MSLR will not accept any transaction request (land registry or membership registry action) that is incomplete. Incomplete means it lacks any required element as per law or MSLR standards: e.g., missing a necessary signature or witness, missing an attached Council resolution for something that requires one, illegible or missing plan numbers, unpaid fees, etc. If a submission is incomplete, MSLR considers that it has not been properly filed and therefore will not queue it for processing.
- Immediate Rejection & Notice: If a submission is deemed incomplete upon initial review, MSLR will immediately reject and return it rather than hold it. The submitter (and relevant parties like the Settlement Land office and the member/applicant) will be provided a Deficiency Notice in writing. This notice will enumerate all identified issues with the submission (e.g., “Form MSLR-02 is missing the transferee’s signature on page 2; the attached survey plan is not signed by an Alberta Land Surveyor; no proof of spousal consent included,” etc.). The notice will clearly state that the Registry has not accepted the filing and that the request will only be processed when a corrected submission is made.
- Consistent Standard: Staff must apply this rule uniformly to everyone – no “informal exceptions” (for instance, in the past, maybe some communities’ forms were habitually incomplete but still processed after phone calls – that will no longer happen). All parties (Settlements, members, external entities like banks or lawyers involved in transactions) will be held to the published submission requirements. This ensures fairness and encourages professionalism in documentation.
- Deadline-Related Submissions: If an incomplete submission was attempting to meet a deadline (e.g., a renewal application just before expiry, or an appeal within 30 days), the deficiency notice serves as evidence that it was not properly filed. MSLR will not extend deadlines arbitrarily for incomplete filings. It is the applicant’s responsibility to file correctly on time. (Again, the recourse for someone who misses a deadline due to an incomplete submission might be an appeal to MSAT for relief, but MSLR will not bend its rules).
Implementation:
- Checklists and Training: MSLR will maintain up-to-date submission checklists for each type of transaction (e.g., “Transfer of Métis Title checklist,” “Name change on Members List checklist,” etc.). Staff receiving an application (either by mail, in-person, or via the portal) will go through the relevant checklist as a quality control. Staff will be trained intensively on the requirements so that they can spot deficiencies instantly.
- Deficiency Notice Template: A standard template for deficiency notices will be used to ensure clarity and completeness. The notice will include: date, file/reference number, identification of the transaction and parties, list of missing/incorrect items, and a statement like “Please correct the above and re-submit. This request has not been recorded in the registry.” The notice will be signed by the Registrar or delegate. One copy goes to the submitting party (if a member or a lawyer, etc.), one to the Settlement office (if they were involved or need to assist the member), and one is kept in an “Incomplete submissions log”.
- Digital Portal Enforcement: The new system will have built-in form validation. For example, if someone tries to submit online and omits a required field, the system will not allow the submission to be finalized until it’s filled. It can also require certain attachments to be uploaded based on the transaction type (like it won’t let a user submit a land transfer without attaching a Council approval if that’s necessary, or without a PDF of a plan if needed). These measures should greatly reduce the incidence of incomplete submissions from the start[24][25].
- Cutover Date: The policy of rejection has technically been in effect since 2009, but we will re-announce it with the modernization. All stakeholders will be reminded that as of the “go-live” of the digital system (or the effective date of this policy update), any file missing information will be immediately sent back. There will be no grace period unless explicitly directed by higher authority. However, MSLR will make efforts to contact the submitter by phone/email upon finding a deficiency before sending the formal notice, especially during the initial transition, to perhaps allow a quick fix if it can be done same-day. But formally, the submission is not accepted until complete.
Impacts:
- Efficiency Gains: Eliminating the practice of holding files waiting for more info frees up staff time and mental space. MSLR can focus on processing fully completed transactions swiftly, rather than babysitting incomplete ones. It also gives a clear message to Settlements and others to “do it right the first time,” which over time will improve the quality of submissions.
- Faster Turnaround: Counterintuitively, while some may worry rejections slow things down, it often means that when a file is resubmitted, it’s correct and can be registered immediately. Overall turnaround for successful filings improves. And because deficiencies are caught at intake, they can often be resolved quicker (especially with digital instant feedback).
- Equality: This policy ensures no favoritism – a common complaint resolved by this is that sometimes people believed certain influential parties got their sloppy paperwork pushed through while others did not. Now everyone must meet the same checklist.
- Record Integrity: By refusing partial or unclear documents, the registry’s records will be more accurate and reliable. Incomplete info can lead to errors if processed (like a wrong land description could cloud title to the wrong parcel). We prevent that at the source.
- Training Needs: There is a burden on applicants and Settlement staff to learn the requirements thoroughly. The guidebook and training (see Implementation Plan and Guidebook sections) will address this, providing clarity on what a “complete” submission entails for each scenario. Over 2025, we anticipate a learning curve, but by enforcing the standard strictly, stakeholders will adapt.
- Digital Divide Concerns: Real-time portal validation means users with online access get immediate prompts to fix issues. Those doing paper might not know until we mail back a notice. To mitigate disparity, Settlement offices will be encouraged to use the portal on behalf of members or at least to review paper forms with the same checklists before sending to MSLR. Thus, even offline submissions can benefit from the same rigor at the local level before they reach us.
Policy 8 – Digital Maps and Plans
Date of Original Approval: June 15, 2010
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Land registration today is inseparable from accurate mapping. In the past, MSLR maintained spatial data in disjointed ways – some plans were on paper/mylar, others in AutoCAD files that were not integrated with any GIS. This made it difficult to verify the exact location and boundaries of interests, especially for unsurveyed or partially surveyed areas. Meanwhile, Alberta’s Land Titles has implemented modern GIS-linked systems (the ARLO parcel map) that allow easy spatial querying of titles. To improve accuracy and service, MSLR needs to adopt digital plan standards. The MSGC Land Policy and MSLR Reg give the Registrar authority to require plans for defining land (e.g., Reg s.83 allows requiring a survey plan before recording an interest in land)[26][27]. This policy sets the standards for plan submissions and the integration of mapping technology into the registry.
Policy Statements:
- Acceptance of Digital Survey Plans: MSLR will accept (and prefer) land survey plans in digital formats (e.g., AutoCAD DWG/DXF, or Land Titles ALTO XML format if available) for any registration requiring a plan. All plans must be prepared and signed by a licensed Alberta Land Surveyor in accordance with the Surveys Act and standards of practice (e.g., include the surveyor’s stamp and digital signature where applicable). A digital plan submission is considered equivalent to a paper plan for legal purposes as long as it is unaltered and properly authenticated.
- ATS and Coordinate Requirements: Survey plans (or descriptive plans) must tie into the Alberta Township System (ATS) or UTM coordinate system so that the land can be placed correctly on a map. Every plan should show coordinates for at least one point or corner, or otherwise relate to known surveyed boundaries. MSLR will require that digital plans pass a coordinate validation – i.e., key points on the plan can be matched with the provincial spatial data. This ensures that our registry isn’t just storing an image of a plan, but actually knows where that land is on the earth.
- Plan Content Standards: Plans must clearly delineate parcel boundaries, and include all relevant easements, rights-of-way, roads, and any encumbrances that are described in the accompanying instrument. If the plan is for a utility right-of-way or similar, a simpler sketch may be allowed (see below), but if it’s for creating new parcels or long-term interests, a formal survey is generally required. We align with industry practice: smaller utility service lines can be shown on sketch plans attached to agreements, while major projects or anything involving third-party interests require full legal surveys[28][29].
- Sketch Plans for Minor Utilities: In line with the 2009 directive, for utility companies installing distribution lines for services to Settlement residents (not major transmission lines), MSLR will not insist on a formal survey plan if the Settlement Council doesn’t require it[29][30]. Instead, a sketch plan or construction drawing attached to the access agreement can suffice, provided it reasonably shows the route and land affected[30]. However, MSLR will require formal survey plans for third-party lines (like a transmission line for an outside company) or any major infrastructure that spans long distances[31]. Essentially, the level of survey detail will be commensurate with the project scale.
- Integration with ARLO: MSLR’s system will integrate with the provincial ARLO parcel mapping. Whenever a plan is registered in MSLR, if it pertains to creating or adjusting parcels, we will reflect that in a GIS layer that overlays with Alberta’s maps. Conversely, we will consume relevant spatial data from Alberta (like base cadastre, township grids) to improve our records. This two-way integration ensures that anyone (with appropriate access) can view Settlement land interests on a map with proper georeferencing.
- Transitional Acceptance of Paper: During a transition period (the next 1-2 years), MSLR will continue to accept traditional paper or mylar plans for those surveyors or offices not ready to submit digitally. However, MSLR will convert any paper plan to a digital format (by scanning and, if needed, tracing key coordinates) for internal use. After the transition, we anticipate making digital submission mandatory, but we will monitor how readily surveyors adapt.
Implementation:
- Surveyor Engagement: MSLR will engage the Alberta Land Surveyors’ Association (ALSA) to inform all practicing surveyors of these standards. We will provide technical specifications for digital files (format, projection, required metadata). We’ll also coordinate with the Director of Surveys office to ensure consistency with provincial requirements. Any training or Q&A needed for surveyors will be facilitated (possibly through a webinar).
- Portal Upload Feature: The portal will include a feature for uploading a plan file alongside the registration request. The system will perform an automatic check – for instance, ensuring the file is in one of the accepted formats and not corrupted. It might also be able to run a basic spatial check (like does the plan fall within known Settlement boundaries?). If the upload fails these checks, the submitter (often a surveyor or Settlement staff) will be prompted to correct it.
- GIS Module: Internally, MSLR will establish a GIS module. All new survey plans will be entered into this GIS. For existing registered interests, legacy AutoCAD drawings (which currently “lack integration”[32]) will be imported so that we have one comprehensive map. The GIS will link each spatial object (parcel or right-of-way) to the corresponding registry entry. We will leverage ARLO’s data where possible – e.g., using the Alberta Parcel Map as a base layer to align our parcels. We’ll also store shape files or coordinates of Settlement boundaries and key reference points.
- Hardware/Software: Ensure MSLR has the software licenses needed (AutoCAD, GIS software, etc.) and hardware capable of handling large map files. Also, a high-quality large format scanner will be used to digitize any paper plans that come in during transition.
- Plan Archive: Digital plans will be archived with redundancy – stored on the server with backups, and also perhaps within the ARLO system if we can register them there for safekeeping. For any critical paper plan submitted, after scanning, the original will still be kept in the fireproof vault as a backup until we are fully confident in digital storage.
- Policy for Requiring a Plan: Staff must remember to enforce MSLR Reg s.83 – if someone submits an interest that does not have a clear physical description, ask for a plan. For example, if a new long-term lease on a piece of land is presented but only described by vague reference, require a sketch or survey showing what area is leased before registering. This ensures every interest registered can be tied to a location on a map.
Impacts:
- Accuracy: By having georeferenced digital plans, the exact location of every interest is known. This reduces boundary disputes and errors. For instance, if two interests accidentally overlapped on paper due to description quirks, a GIS will catch that conflict visually.
- Efficiency of Searches: Staff (and authorized users via portal) can search for land interests visually on a map, not just by legal description. This is particularly useful in Settlement areas where addressing is sometimes less formal. For example, looking up “where is John Doe’s land?” could be done by a map query if needed.
- Integration with Province: Using ARLO standards means if in the future any Settlement lands become titled lands or interface with the provincial system (e.g., a utility right-of-way leaving the settlement), the data will mesh. It also helps if the province or any external agency needs to understand Settlement parcels for things like infrastructure planning, they can overlay our data easily.
- Reduced Costs Over Time: Requiring full survey plans only when necessary (as per our utility line differentiation) saves Settlements money and time[33][34]. Smaller projects won’t be burdened by hiring surveyors for expensive plans when a simple sketch will do. This was a lesson from 2009 when it was realized mandating surveys in all cases was too onerous[33][34]. The policy now strikes a balance – light requirements for minor works, strict for major ones.
- Training and Transition: Some people may need training to read digital plans or use the GIS tools. Settlement staff might not all be used to this. We’ll implement training sessions (see Implementation Plan) on basic GIS viewing. The portal interface will try to make it user-friendly (like an interactive map where you can toggle layers for parcels, etc.). There may also be a cultural shift: historically, a big rolled paper plan felt “official” – we need to build trust that the digital copy is just as legitimate and in fact better. Over time, as successful usage accumulates, comfort will increase.
- Risk Mitigation: Storing data digitally introduces risk of technical failures, but our data sovereignty and backup measures[32][35] address that. We’re also mitigating the risk of not having digital – which was the concern of losing or damaging sole copies of paper plans. With replication and backups, the security of plans is improved.
Policy 9 – Estate Instructions
Date of Original Approval: April 19, 2006
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: “Estate instructions” are documents by which a Settlement member designates who should receive their land interests upon their death, as allowed under MSA and the MSGC Land Policy (MSGC Land Policy section 7.8 provides for how land may be transferred via a will or instruction upon death). Proper handling of estate instructions is crucial to ensure that, when a member passes away, their land is transferred to the rightful heir without disputes, while also respecting limitations (for instance, only Settlement members can hold Settlement land interests, so one cannot will land to a non-member except through mechanisms like sale). Historically, issues arose such as multiple conflicting instructions on file, or instructions that tried to split an interest among many people (which the law doesn’t allow). Also, estate instructions contain sensitive information and should remain confidential until needed. This policy codifies how MSLR manages estate instructions to ensure smooth succession of land interests and legal compliance.
Policy Statements:
- Whole-Interest Transfers Only: An estate instruction can only direct the transfer of a land interest in its entirety to a single beneficiary (or joint beneficiaries if they are allowed and both eligible). Splitting one land interest among multiple people (e.g., leaving half to one child and half to another) is not permitted unless the interest is formally subdivided into separate interests before death. If MSLR receives an estate instruction that attempts to divide an interest, MSLR will advise the member (if still alive) or note that only one person can be recognized and the instruction may be invalid in part. Essentially, the estate instruction must result in one successor per interest, maintaining one interest = one title holder, consistent with land fragmentation rules and MSGC policy.
- No Conflict with Lifetime Transactions: If a member undertakes a land transaction while alive (like selling or gifting land) that conflicts with what their estate instruction says, the registered lifetime transaction will take precedence. In other words, an estate instruction is not a substitute for updating the registry during life. For example, if a member’s estate instruction left their land to their daughter, but then before passing, the member had already transferred that land to their son, the estate instruction for that land is moot. MSLR will not honor estate instructions insofar as they pertain to interests that were not actually held by the deceased at time of death.
- Most Recent Instruction Prevails: MSLR will only consider the latest dated, valid estate instruction on file for a member as their true final wishes. If multiple estate instructions are found in the registry records for the same person, the one with the most recent execution date (and which meets all validity criteria) will supersede any prior ones. Earlier ones will be considered revoked. To aid clarity, when a new estate instruction is filed, MSLR will mark older ones as “superseded” in the records.
- Confidentiality: Estate instructions filed with MSLR are to be kept confidential during the member’s lifetime. They are not open for public or even family viewing. Only the member (and any authorized individual by the member) can access their content. Upon the member’s death, information from the instruction will be disclosed only to those necessary to implement it: the beneficiary, the executor of the estate, the Settlement Council (if needed to approve a transfer), and any relevant authorities. MSLR staff are required to handle these documents sensitively, securing them from any unauthorized access.
- Verification of Eligibility: MSLR will, upon the member’s death, verify that the named beneficiary is eligible to hold Settlement land (i.e. is a Settlement member or will become one as per MSA eligibility). If the named heir is not a member and there’s no legal provision to allow them to hold the land, the instruction may not be enforceable – likely the land would revert to the Settlement or alternate arrangements per MSA. (MSA and MSGC policy have rules that generally only members can inherit Settlement land; if a non-member relative is named, usually they must transfer or be compensated rather than become an owner). MSLR will coordinate with the Settlement in such cases to follow the proper procedure (perhaps an option for the non-member to receive cash instead, etc., as per legislation).
Implementation:
- Filing Process: Members can file estate instructions with MSLR by submitting the standard form (MSLR-18 or updated equivalent). The form must be witnessed appropriately (two witnesses or a commissioner for oaths, akin to a will requirement) to ensure validity. MSLR will check that the form is properly filled (only one beneficiary per interest, etc.) before accepting it. If the member has multiple land interests, they can list different beneficiaries for each interest (that’s fine; the rule is one interest -> one person, but each interest can go to a different person).
- Digital Vault: The Digital Portal will include an “Estate Instructions Vault” where scanned copies or digital originals of these instructions are stored in an encrypted form. Each member’s instructions are tagged to their profile. Access to this Vault will be restricted – likely only the Registrar and one delegated officer have full access, under dual-control principles (to avoid any tampering).
- Acknowledgment Receipt: When an estate instruction is filed, MSLR will send the member an acknowledgment (and maybe a reference number). This reassures the member that their instructions are on file. If they later want to update or revoke it, they should file a new one or a revocation letter.
- Cross-Check at Transactions: The system will, whenever a transaction affecting an interest is registered (like a transfer or new mortgage), flag if there is an estate instruction on file for that interest. This is just for awareness; it won’t stop the transaction, but it alerts staff that an existing instruction might need updating (though that’s the member’s responsibility, not MSLR’s, it’s good to be aware).
- Post-Decease Procedure: Upon notification that a member has passed away (which typically will come from a Settlement Council or family along with a death certificate), MSLR will look up any estate instructions. Staff will retrieve the most recent instruction from the Vault. They will then reach out to the named beneficiary or the estate executor to coordinate the transfer. If the beneficiary is a Settlement member, the process is to fill out the required transfer forms (often the estate executor signs a transfer instrument to the beneficiary, citing the estate instruction as authority). If Settlement Council approval is needed for the transfer (some settlements may require council motion to formally acknowledge the new owner), MSLR will wait for that. Then the land interest is registered in the beneficiary’s name (or Metis Title issued if applicable). If there is no estate instruction, land would revert to Settlement as per default law and that will be followed instead.
- Record Update: After completing an estate transfer, the instruction that was executed will be marked “fulfilled” and kept in archive. If multiple interests were in one instruction, each interest line will be annotated as fulfilled or if partially not fulfilled (like a beneficiary ineligible scenario), note what was done (perhaps interest went to Settlement). If any disputes arise (e.g., someone contests the validity of the instruction as a will), MSLR will defer to MSAT or courts to resolve – we won’t adjudicate will contests; we’ll hold off transfers until the dispute is settled legally.
- Education: MSLR will include guidance in public materials encouraging members to keep their estate instructions up to date and to inform their families that one is on file. Also, to clarify that if they sell/gift their land during life, that overrides the instruction, to avoid confusion.
Impacts:
- Orderly Succession: This policy ensures when members pass, their wishes (within legal bounds) are carried out smoothly. It helps prevent land interests from being stuck in limbo or causing family disputes because MSLR will have a clear authoritative document to follow (like a will specifically for Settlement land).
- Legal Integrity: By enforcing whole-interest transfer and eligibility rules, it keeps us compliant with MSGC Land Policy and MSA which aim to prevent fragmentation of lands and ensure only members hold land. If someone tried something outside the rules in their estate instruction, it won’t be executed, avoiding illegal outcomes.
- Confidentiality and Trust: Members will have confidence to file estate instructions knowing MSLR will keep them secret until needed. This might encourage more members to use this tool (currently some may hesitate fearing their info isn’t private). Increased uptake is good – it reduces cases of intestacy (no will) where land would automatically revert to the Settlement and potentially cause hardship to families.
- Administrative readiness: Having a secure vault and a clear process means when a death is reported, MSLR can act quickly. That prevents long delays where surviving family members might otherwise be unsure if they can occupy or use the land. The beneficiary gets formal ownership sooner, allowing them to carry on with minimal disruption.
- Consistency: Historically perhaps not all estate instructions were handled uniformly (depending on who was Registrar). Now there’s a standard – e.g., always take the latest one, check it thoroughly, etc. If multiple instructions were filed in old records without clear indication which is last, this policy clarifies to use date to decide.
- Record-Keeping: Linking estate instructions to the registry digitally also helps ensure they don’t get lost or overlooked. It addresses a risk that was identified about document integrity – by storing them securely and logging any access, we ensure these critical documents remain unaltered and accessible when needed (part of data integrity improvement).
Policy 10 – Limits on Member Land Holdings
Date of Original Approval: August 30, 2006
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: The MSGC Land Policy (as well as some Settlement bylaws) imposes acreage caps on how much land a single member can hold, to promote equitable distribution of land within the community. For example, a Settlement might say no member can hold more than X acres of land interests in total. Under previous regimes, enforcing these caps was challenging – the Land Registry had no mechanism to automatically prevent someone from acquiring over-limit land; it was largely up to Settlement Councils to monitor. Additionally, the legal authority of MSLR to outright refuse a registration solely because it breaks an MSGC policy limit has some ambiguity, since the MSA/MSLR Reg didn’t explicitly empower the Registrar to police this, except perhaps as a “not in order” reason. This policy clarifies MSLR’s stance: we will support and flag the limits, but we will not exceed our jurisdiction (i.e., we won’t invalidate transactions if the current law doesn’t clearly allow us to do so on that basis).
Policy Statements:
- Enforcement for Patent Métis Title: For permanent Métis Title (equivalent to fee simple) acquisitions, MSLR will enforce the MSGC Land Policy acreage limit strictly. That means if a transfer or grant of a new Métis Title would put a member over the allowed acreage, MSLR will refuse to register that transaction. The applicant would be informed that the transfer cannot proceed unless they divest other lands or obtain a policy exemption. This is supported by the MSGC Land Policy authority that no one should have beyond the limit, and since Métis Title is akin to ownership, we consider it critical to enforce.
- PMTs and Allotments (Temporary Interests): If a transaction involving a Provisional Métis Title or Allotment (which are term or conditional interests) would cause a member to exceed the land cap, MSLR will accept the registration (since current regulation doesn’t give clear power to reject), but flag it. Specifically, the registry will record the interest with a warning note that “Member exceeds land holding limit by this interest – subject to policy review.” We will notify the Settlement Council and MSGC Land Governance of the situation. Essentially, we won’t unilaterally block it, but we won’t ignore it either. We anticipate that in most cases, Settlement Councils themselves will not approve an allotment that breaks the rules, but if it somehow comes through, we handle it this way.
- Notifications of Exceedance: Whenever any registration is processed that brings a member’s total holdings over, or a member already over limit submits another, MSLR will send a notification letter to that member and the relevant Settlement Council advising of the policy exceedance. The letter will clarify that while the registration may have been recorded (for a PMT/Allotment), it is against policy and could be subject to future action (like not renewing some interest, etc., per MSGC directives). This is partly to make sure no one can later say they were unaware of being over the limit.
- No Fragmentation via Proxies: The policy also keeps an eye on potential evasion – e.g., members using relatives or companies to hold land on their behalf to circumvent limits. If evidence of such arrangements comes to light, MSLR will alert MSGC and the Settlements for investigation. MSLR’s role is not to adjudicate those cases, but to provide data and support enforcement of the spirit of the rules.
Implementation:
- System Calculation: The Digital Registry will have a module that calculates total acreage held by each member. It will aggregate all interests (Métis title, PMT, allotment) that a member holds and sum the land area. We will input the official acreage cap number (which might be, say, 10 acres, or 1 quarter-section, etc., depending on policy) into the system parameters. Each time a new interest is about to be registered, the system will simulate adding it and check against the cap. If the result exceeds the cap, it will alert the Registrar.
- Staff Procedures: When an over-cap alert occurs: If the interest is a permanent Métis Title issuance or transfer, staff will prepare a refusal notice citing the land cap policy. They will not complete the registration. If it’s a PMT/Allotment, staff will proceed to register (assuming all else is in order), but will mark the interest as “Exceeds cap” in a comments field and trigger the notifications as described. All such cases will be logged.
- Reporting: The system will produce monthly reports of any members nearing the cap (e.g., at 75% or more of limit) and those exceeding. These reports will be shared with MSGC’s Lands Committee or equivalent, so policy makers can track trends. This might inform whether caps need adjustments or if enforcement needs tightening at the Council level.
- Communication: MSLR will update its public guides to inform members of the cap. Also, when people come in for transfers or new allocations, Settlement Land Clerks should remind them of the existence of caps. This proactive communication may prevent unpleasant surprises at registration time.
- Legal Clarification (Long Term): MSLR, through Indigenous Relations, may seek a regulatory amendment or explicit authority in the future to allow refusal of over-cap PMTs as well. In the interim, our partial measure is taken with caution (to not overstep legal bounds). If at some point legislation changes empowering the Registrar to fully enforce all aspects of the land cap, this policy will be updated accordingly.
Impacts:
- Promotion of Fair Land Distribution: By enforcing (at least for titled land) and highlighting (for other interests) the limits, we actively uphold the intent of MSGC’s policy to prevent land hoarding. This helps maintain community harmony – it’s a long-standing principle in the Settlements that everyone should have a reasonable chance at land, and no small group should control all of it.
- Avoiding Legal Overreach: Our nuanced approach (enforce where clearly authorized, flag where not) ensures MSLR doesn’t invite legal challenges. If we outright denied an allotment transfer due to the cap without clear legislative authority, a member might successfully challenge that denial. Instead, by registering but flagging, we put the onus on policy bodies to deal with it (e.g., maybe council will choose not to renew one of the person’s PMTs later). This covers MSLR legally while still supporting the policy’s intent.
- Data-Driven Decisions: The reporting and notifications mean that, for the first time, there will be a comprehensive view of land holding patterns. If numerous members are approaching the cap, maybe the cap is too low or Settlement population/needs have shifted – MSGC could revisit. Or if a certain Settlement has many over-cap via allotments, maybe enforcement at that level needs adjustment. MSLR becomes a source of valuable data for governance.
- Member Behavior: Knowing that the system will flag them, members might be dissuaded from trying to quietly accumulate excess land. Or if they truly need more land for a project, they might proactively seek a policy exemption or community approval rather than going around the rules.
- Workload: There will be some extra work in generating letters and managing these flags, but likely the cases are few. Historically, not many members exceed caps because local politics often stop it. However, modernization might make it easier to catch those that do, so we might see an uptick initially as we “discover” any previously uncaught situations. Over time, though, it should stabilize as behavior adjusts.
Policy 11 – Interests on Unsurveyed Land
Date of Original Approval: July 26, 2007
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Large portions of Settlement lands have not been formally surveyed into parcels. Yet, Settlements may issue land interests (like grazing licenses, plots for cabins, etc.) on these unsurveyed tracts. In the provincial system, you generally cannot register an interest without a proper legal description from a survey; however, the Settlements historically permitted descriptive or interim methods. The challenge is to register these interests in MSLR in a way that they are sufficiently identified to be meaningful, and to ensure that eventually, as surveys catch up, these interests attach to proper surveyed parcels. This policy outlines how to handle registrations on unsurveyed land areas, balancing practicality with the need for future precision.
Policy Statements:
- Descriptive Registration Allowed: MSLR will continue to register interests on unsurveyed land using descriptive identifiers, but it requires certain forms of description to ensure clarity. Acceptable description methods include: reference to the Alberta Township System (ATS) (e.g., “NW 1/4 of 34-XX-XX-W4M, excepting 5 acre area around old sawmill” – though partial quarter sections are tricky, we’d likely require a sketch); GPS coordinates outlining the perimeter or key points of the land (e.g., listing lat/long of the corners of the area, if surveyed by handheld GPS or better); natural boundary descriptions (e.g., “bounded on the north by Owl River, on the east by the lake shore, approximately 500m south from the road” – to be used only for very temporary or minor interests due to vagueness); or an unregistered sketch plan drawn to scale with measurements. The goal is that anyone later can reasonably identify the location and extent of the interest.
- Flag for Survey Requirement: Any interest registered on unsurveyed land will be flagged in the registry as “Survey Pending.” This indicates that once a formal survey of that area is done, the interest should be tied to a surveyed lot or updated description. MSLR will not issue a patent Métis Title for an unsurveyed area – before finalizing into Métis Title, the land must be surveyed. For PMTs or allocations on unsurveyed lands, the expectation is that a survey will occur before those convert to long-term interests.
- Limitation on Subdivision or Transfer: Interests on unsurveyed lands cannot be subdivided or partially transferred until a proper survey is conducted. Essentially, the interest as a whole can be transferred to another member if needed, but you can’t take an unsurveyed interest and split it into two new interests easily – that should await a survey that delineates those parts.
- Priority for Survey: If there are multiple interests overlapping in unsurveyed areas (hopefully rare, but could happen if described loosely), their priority will be determined by date of registration and whatever the descriptive info says. Overlaps will be noted and Settlements will need to resolve them (through survey or cancellation of one). MSLR’s role is to highlight potential overlaps (e.g., by mapping coordinates and seeing an intersect).
- Collaboration with Surveys: MSLR has the authority to require surveys per Reg s.83 before recording an interest[26], and it will use this authority for any substantial or permanent interest on unsurveyed land. For minor or interim interests (like a short-term license), MSLR may waive immediate survey but still keep the expectation of eventual surveying.
Implementation:
- Spatial Module Use: The GIS module described in Policy 8 will be extremely useful here. When an interest on unsurveyed land is submitted, staff will input any provided coordinates or sketch into the GIS. This creates a rough polygon of the interest. Over time, as actual surveys occur, these polygons can be matched to real surveyed parcels.
- Template Descriptions: Provide templates or examples to Settlement administrators for how to describe unsurveyed parcels. For instance, recommend that if possible, they get a local surveyor or technician to do a quick GPS boundary logging. A set of coordinates is far better than an anecdotal description. We might even consider equipping Settlement land offices with handheld GPS devices for this purpose and training them.
- Survey Planning: Work with the Director of Surveys or Alberta’s mapping agencies to prioritize surveying in Settlement areas where there are active registered interests but no official plans. Possibly, a program can be initiated (with funding, see Budget) to gradually survey high-interest areas in cooperation with Settlements. Meanwhile, maintain a registry list of “areas needing survey.”
- Member Communication: When a member receives an interest on unsurveyed land (say they get allocated a 10-acre homestead in an area not subdivided yet), provide them with a notice that “This land is not officially surveyed. Your interest is recorded by description. Be aware that a formal survey will be required in the future to finalize boundaries, which might result in slight adjustments. Major developments (building a house, etc.) should consider likely survey lines to avoid encroachment.” This manages expectations that things might shift a bit when actual surveying occurs.
- Data Conversion: For existing unsurveyed interests in our records, attempt to enhance their descriptions. Old records might say “NE of lake, approximately 4 acres for John Doe.” We should, where possible, go out (or ask Settlement) to get better description or coordinates for these and update the registry entry with that info. This could be part of the records audit.
Impacts:
- Continued Flexibility: Settlements can continue to allocate and use land even if survey resources are limited, without breaking the registry system. We accommodate traditional or practical land use while planning for eventual formalization.
- Improved Clarity: By standardizing how we describe unsurveyed interest locations (using ATS, GPS, etc.), we drastically improve the clarity compared to vague historical descriptions. Future generations will better understand what exactly was meant, and the transition to surveyed parcels will be smoother.
- Prevents Legal Void: Without this policy, one might argue unsurveyed interests shouldn’t be recorded at all (since they’re not well-defined). But that would leave those interests legally unprotected. Recording them with best-possible description at least gives them some standing and priority. It acknowledges reality (land is used even if not fully surveyed) and provides interim legal recognition.
- Workflow Impact: There is extra work in mapping these and possibly assisting with getting coordinates. But this effort pays off by avoiding disputes. Also, it leverages new tech: previously, in 2007, GPS usage might have been less – now it’s quite accessible, so let’s use it to solve an old problem.
- Long-Term Survey Cost: This policy basically anticipates that eventually everything should be surveyed. That implies a commitment that might cost money and time (likely beyond just MSLR’s scope, involving broader capital investment). However, identifying and flagging where surveys are needed can help in budgeting and requesting funds (e.g., through capital plans to survey X hectares per year). Over the next decade, this could lead to fully surveyed Settlements, which is a big positive for tenure security.
- Member and Council Awareness: People will understand that an “unsurveyed” interest is a bit provisional. It’s valid, but its exact shape is pending. This may reduce conflicts (like two neighbours arguing over a boundary that wasn’t surveyed; with GPS points on file, at least they have some reference, and they know a formal survey will come to finalize it).
Policy 12 – Allocation Interests
Date of Original Approval: July 26, 2007
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: “Allocations” in the Settlement context often refer to provisional or conditional land grants given to members, which are expected to be converted into long-term interests (like PMTs or Métis Title) once certain conditions are met (such as residency, development of the land, etc.). They were intended to prevent tying up land indefinitely without commitment. In practice, some allocations lingered for years without conversion, causing uncertainty – does the member really have rights or can the land be given to someone else? This policy sets rules to ensure allocations don’t become perpetual limbo interests and are either upgraded to proper interests or released.
Policy Statements:
- Fixed Term for Allocations: Any new allocation interest granted to a member must have a defined term or expiry date (for example, a 3-year term within which the member must qualify for a PMT, etc.). MSLR will not register an allocation that is open-ended. Typically, the term might be set in the allocation agreement or Council’s allocation resolution. If not explicitly stated, MSLR will assume a standard term (say 3 or 5 years, as per prevailing policy) and record that as the default.
- Conversion or Renewal: Before an allocation expires, the member holding it should either convert it to a Provisional Métis Title or Métis Title (if they now meet criteria and apply for such), renew the allocation (with Settlement Council approval, if more time is justified), or relinquish it. MSLR will notify the Settlement and member ahead of expiry (similar to PMT expiries) to prompt action. If an allocation reaches its expiry date with no conversion or approved renewal, MSLR will mark it as expired and cancel it from the registry[36][37]. The land then reverts to available status for reallocation by the Settlement.
- No Transfers of Allocations: Allocation interests are generally not transferable between members (since they’re intended as a personal probationary grant). MSLR will reject any attempt to transfer an allocation to another person. The only way for someone else to get that land is for the allocation to expire or be cancelled and then be reallocated anew by the Settlement to the other person. The exception might be in estate cases – if a member dies while holding an allocation, some policies allowed a surviving spouse or child to continue it. MSLR will allow that kind of succession transfer if Settlement Council approves, treating it akin to an estate instruction case (but ideally they’d just issue a new allocation to the heir). In any event, no sale or commercial transfer of an allocation is allowed.
- Monitoring and Reporting: MSLR will keep track of all allocations on the books and periodically inform Settlement Councils of which allocations are nearing expiry or have not been acted on. This transparency pushes local leadership to make decisions – either help the member convert to a PMT if they’ve fulfilled requirements, or decide to formally end the allocation if not.
- One Allocation per Member: As a rule, a member should generally only have one active allocation at a time (since it’s meant to eventually become their primary land interest). While not an absolute legal rule, MSLR will flag if a Settlement tries to allocate multiple parcels to the same person concurrently, as that might circumvent the spirit (if they are effectively giving the person more land than others via multiple allocations). MSLR will consult with the Settlement in such cases to ensure it’s intentional and fair.
Implementation:
- Database Fields: Add fields in the registry for allocation interests such as “Allocation Expiry Date” and “Conditions/Notes”. When registering an allocation, staff must input the expiry. If none provided, use a default per policy (we will coordinate with MSGC on what default to use – say 5 years).
- Notifications: Similar to PMT expiry notices, the system will generate a reminder (say 6 months before expiry) to the member and Settlement that “Allocation #123 is set to expire on [date]. If you wish to renew or convert this allocation, please take action.” At expiry, if no renewal or conversion is filed, the system will automatically move it to expired status.
- Renewal Process: If a Settlement Council approves an extension of an allocation (perhaps the member is close to meeting criteria and they want to give another year), they should send that resolution to MSLR. MSLR will then update the expiry date in the system. Ideally, a formal allocation renewal form will be used. We will incorporate such forms and processes (likely MSGC will create or update policy on this).
- Conversion Process: When a member with an allocation applies for a Provisional Métis Title for that same land, they should indicate it’s a conversion. Once the PMT is granted and registered, MSLR will cancel the allocation entry simultaneously. The system can link the two so that it knows “allocation X became PMT Y” for historical reference. We will ensure no double-counting (the land interest shouldn’t appear active as allocation once it’s PMT).
- Audit of Existing Allocations: We will review current records for allocations. There may be some old ones (e.g., from the 1990s or early 2000s) that never got formally expired or converted. MSLR will compile a list of such cases and work with each Settlement to resolve them (either retroactively cancel if the member didn’t do anything and maybe isn’t even around, or convert if in practice the person was treated as having a PMT). This cleanup is important so we start the modern system with a clean slate.
- Member Communication: Inform members who receive allocations that it’s a time-limited interest and what they need to do to secure long-term land rights (e.g., build a dwelling, or reside X years, etc., depending on Settlement’s criteria). MSLR’s role isn’t to enforce those criteria, but making sure the member is aware will help them follow through and not lose the land inadvertently.
Impacts:
- Prevents Land Banking: Members can’t just hold allocations forever without fulfilling requirements. Land will cycle back to the community if not used as intended. This ensures active use of Settlement land and fairness.
- Motivates Compliance: Members with allocations have clear deadlines, which likely motivates them to meet the conditions (e.g., if they need to establish residence to get a PMT, they know they have X years or they lose the opportunity).
- Administrative Clarity: The registry will reflect reality more accurately. No more mystery allocations floating around – each will either become something or die off. That clarity helps in land management and reporting (e.g., MSGC can report “we have ___ number of active allocations, with average remaining term Y”).
- Workload: MSLR will have to send notices and track these, but it should be manageable via automation. The initial audit of legacy allocations might be a chunk of work, but it’s a one-time project that will bring significant clarity.
- Policy Alignment: This essentially enforces what was always intended in policy (see older directives highlighting need to not let allocations go indefinite[38][39]). It also closes any loophole of someone treating an allocation like a permanent property without actually converting to a proper title.
- Community Benefits: Land that isn’t being earnestly claimed gets freed sooner for someone else who might make better use. Conversely, those who are serious about their allocation will turn it into a PMT or title and gain secure rights – which can help them invest in the land (build a home, etc.) since now they have a formal long-term interest. The policy ensures that transition happens or the opportunity passes on.
Policy 13 – Survey Plan Requirements
Date of Original Approval: January 25, 2009
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: This policy complements Policy 8, but specifically addresses when a survey plan is required by MSLR for certain transactions. Historically, there was debate over requiring full survey plans for things like utility rights-of-way, which wasn’t explicitly mandated by law but was done for clarity[27][33]. In 2009, guidelines were introduced to ease requirements for certain utility installations to avoid burdening Settlements with unnecessary survey costs[33][34]. This modernized policy confirms those decisions and provides a general rule for when an interest must have a professional survey plan.
Policy Statements:
- Interests Requiring Survey Plan: Any long-term or permanent interest that defines a new parcel or affects land boundaries must be accompanied by a legal survey plan prepared by an Alberta Land Surveyor. This includes: - New Métis Title grants (aside from whole-parcel transfers of existing titled parcels, which already have plans). - Long-term leases or exclusive use areas that carve out a part of a section (to ensure the exact area is known). - Rights-of-way or easements for third parties (e.g., a pipeline or transmission line by a utility company that spans Settlement land)[31]. - Any situation where unclear boundaries could lead to disputes or where required by Council or by law. - Interests Not Requiring Full Survey: Short-term, low-impact interests or those covering large unsurveyed areas for public service may not require an immediate survey. Specifically, distribution power lines or local utility hookups serving Settlement members do not require a formal survey plan for MSLR purposes[29]. Instead, as per Policy 8, a sketch or route map suffices. Additionally, licenses for activities like trapping or grazing that cover broad zones can be described without a formal survey, unless they fence off a specific parcel. Essentially, if an interest does not grant exclusive use of a defined ground area, a survey can be optional.
- Council’s Discretion: If a Settlement Council specifically requires a survey plan for a particular interest (even if not mandatory by this policy), MSLR will uphold that and expect the plan. Conversely, if Council is comfortable with a sketch for a minor local service line, MSLR will not impose a survey requirement either. We work in tandem with local governance on this.
- Plan Standards: When a survey plan is required, it must meet standards: drawn to scale, show bearings and distances, tie into known survey markers or ATS grid, include any necessary easement dimensions, etc. If it’s a utility plan, ideally tie into existing surveyed roads or property lines for reference. MSLR may reject a plan that doesn’t clearly delineate the land affected (for instance, a blurry photocopy with no measurements would not be acceptable).
Implementation:
- Guidance to Applicants: MSLR will update application checklists to state when a survey plan is needed. For example, on a Métis Title application form, include “attach survey plan of land if not already surveyed.” For a utility company applying to register a caveat or ROW, include guidance on when we expect a plan vs when a sketch is okay. Possibly we’ll maintain a one-pager matrix: Interest Type vs. Plan Required Yes/No.
- Registrar’s Discretion: The Registrar (or delegate) will review incoming submissions for compliance. If an interest arrives without a survey plan and staff believe one is needed, they will inform the applicant that a plan is required before processing (essentially a deficiency as per Policy 7). They should cite this policy and, if useful, reference MSLR Reg s.83 which backs the Registrar’s authority to demand a plan[26].
- Interdepartmental Coordination: Work with utility companies and other frequent applicants (TELUS, ATCO, etc.) to ensure they know our requirements. Possibly develop a standard that matches what Land Titles does (they often require a plan for pipeline rights-of-way, etc., unless it’s an attachment to a caveat). The goal is to avoid surprises for these companies when dealing with Settlement lands.
- Records for Survey Exemptions: When we accept a sketch in lieu of a survey (like for a small power line), note that in the entry so future staff know it wasn’t an oversight. E.g., “Plan: Sketch accepted as per Policy 13 for local utility line.” This way if someone later questions why no survey, it’s clear it was per policy exception.
- Evolving Tech: Keep an eye on technology – for instance, if drone mapping or other lower-cost surveying methods become available and accepted by ALSA for certain projects, we might incorporate those. Right now, the line is basically formal ALS certified survey vs. informal sketch. In future, there might be intermediate “validated plan” options.
Impacts:
- Cost Savings: By not requiring full surveys for every little thing, we save Settlements and members significant costs (surveyors can be expensive). The 2009 change to not require mylar plans for local utility hookups was specifically to avoid “huge financial burden with minimal value”[33][34]. We continue that sensible approach.
- Maintaining Order: For major land dealings, we still insist on surveys, preserving the overall cadastre integrity. So when large parcels change or new titles are created, they’ll be properly plotted. This ensures the official map of the Settlement evolves in an orderly way and that any external interactions (like a pipeline crossing Settlement land) have clear documentation, which is important for legal protection and possibly taxation agreements[40].
- Flexibility & Local Control: The policy’s deference to Settlement Council requirements allows each community some say. If one Settlement is comfortable being more lenient on certain things, they can; if another wants every lease surveyed for precision, they can do that too. MSLR acts as the gatekeeper to ensure minimal standards but not one-size-fits-all beyond those.
- Clarity for MSLR Staff: Staff no longer have to guess or negotiate each time (“Should I demand a survey? They didn’t give one...”). They have criteria to follow, which speeds up processing.
- Legal Alignment: We still conform to MSA and Regs because Reg 83 explicitly empowers requiring a survey for recording interests[26]. We are just defining when we use that power. There’s no conflict with legislation in allowing sketches for some cases because those are typically registered as caveats or conditional interests anyway, not final titles.
- Overall Outcome: Over time, as general surveying catches up, more and more of these interests will anyway fall into surveyed context. This policy basically manages the transition period where not everything is fully surveyed but lots of development is happening.
Policy 14 – Document Alterations and Corrections
Date of Original Approval: March 15, 2009
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: People occasionally make mistakes on documents submitted to MSLR – typos, or small changes (like crossing out a name and writing another, etc.). Additionally, sometimes errors are discovered in registered documents (e.g., misspelled names, incorrect land descriptions) that need fixing. There is a need for a clear policy on what constitutes a minor clerical correction that MSLR staff can do vs. a material alteration that requires a formal new instrument or a legal process. Historically, registry staff sometimes tried to interpret whether an alteration on a document was initialed properly or whether to accept it, which could put them in a tricky position beyond their jurisdiction[41][42]. This policy clarifies how to handle document alterations and corrections in the registry to maintain integrity while not causing unnecessary delay.
Policy Statements:
- Minor Clerical Errors: If a document submitted for registration has a clear minor error (e.g., a misspelling of a common word, a transposed digit in a lot number, etc.), MSLR staff may correct the error prior to registration only if the intent is obvious and doing so does not change any substantive rights. For example, if a transfer form says land “Plan 762-XXX” but the actual plan is “762-XXX-1” and it’s clearly a minor omission, staff can add the “-1” if they verify the intent from context. These corrections must be noted (initialed and dated by staff on the document or in an attached note) and the original wording preserved (don’t white-out, just mark the correction).
- Substantive Alterations Not Allowed: Any change that could affect parties’ rights or obligations is considered material and MSLR will not unilaterally correct it[43][44]. Examples: changing a name (John to Jake) unless it’s just a spelling; changing an acreage amount; altering terms of an agreement; adding a name as a co-owner, etc. If such issues are found, MSLR will reject the document and ask for a replacement or a properly executed amendment from the parties. Essentially, we do not guess at intent for anything significant – that’s outside our jurisdiction.
- Alterations on Documents (by parties): Many documents come in where parties have crossed something out or written something in by hand. MSLR will accept documents with alterations only if there is clear evidence that all affected parties agreed to the change (e.g., each alteration is initialed by all signatories, or an attached letter from all confirming the change). If an alteration is un-initialed or ambiguous, we will treat the document as defective. For instance, if someone edited the consideration amount and only the grantor initialed it, that’s not fully valid – both grantor and grantee should. In absence of that, a fresh document should be done.
- Post-Registration Corrections: If an error is discovered after registration (say a name was misspelled in our records, or a number mistyped), MSLR can correct the registry entry to match the actual document or legal reality, but it must keep a record of the original entry and the correction. This will be done via issuing a formal Correction Notice in the registry. The notice will cite what was corrected, why (e.g., “Misspelling of surname corrected from ‘Macdonald’ to ‘MacDonald’ to match legal ID”), date, and who authorized it[45][46]. The original erroneous information remains in the archived history for audit trail. If the correction is more than clerical (e.g., an entire interest was recorded against the wrong parcel), typically that would involve a formal order (like MSAT or court order) to amend – MSLR by itself won’t relocate interests without higher direction.
- Approvals for Corrections: Any correction made by staff must be approved by the Registrar or Deputy Registrar before finalizing. This oversight ensures one person isn’t making inappropriate changes. Additionally, if a correction might impact a Settlement Council’s records or a member, they should be informed (e.g., if we correct a land description, let the council know in case they need to update local maps).
Implementation:
- Training on Alteration Principles: Staff will be trained on basic contract law principles regarding alterations (for example, the concept that a material alteration without consent can void a document[43]). We will use examples from past cases to illustrate what is minor vs. major. We will likely develop a quick reference chart: e.g., “Misspelled name = minor (correct with note); Changed interest holder = major (reject).”
- New Forms Design: To minimize alterations, MSLR’s updated forms and the digital submission process will aim to reduce errors (drop-down menus for land descriptions, name auto-fill from member list, etc.). If we can eliminate common mistakes at input, there’s less need for later fixes.
- Correction Log: Implement a “Correction Log” in the system where every registry correction (post-registration) is recorded with who, when, why. This might be part of the audit trail that users with appropriate access can see (ensuring transparency). Possibly have the system automatically mark entries as “Corrected” if changed, with a link to the Correction Notice.
- Member/Stakeholder Notification: If a correction affects an issued certificate (like a Métis Title certificate), MSLR will issue a corrected certificate. For instance, if a title was issued with a typo in the name, after correction, a new certificate is printed and given out, stamped “Corrected on [date]”. We’ll request return of the erroneous one if possible. Similarly, if something like a plan number was wrong, updated abstracts should be sent to those who have them.
- Use of Registrar’s Rules: The MSLR Registrar’s Rules (if any exist akin to Land Titles’ for minor corrections) will be referenced or developed. In Land Titles, there’s often an affidavit of correctness or a statutory declaration process for some corrections. We might adapt something: e.g., if a party realized they made an error, they could sign a statutory declaration for MSLR to correct it. This gives a formal backing to the change beyond MSLR’s own initiative. This might be used for borderline cases where we want the party’s confirmation in writing.
Impacts:
- Registry Integrity: By systematically handling corrections, we maintain a high level of trust in the registry. Users (members, lawyers, banks) will know that if an entry is shown, it reflects the executed documents or authorized changes, not random clerical mistakes. And if mistakes occurred, there’s a clear, traceable method we fix them by. The digital audit trail of all changes ensures no suspicion of secret alterations[47][48].
- Avoiding Legal Disputes: Following these rules reduces the likelihood of disputes. For example, if we refused to accept a questionable altered document instead of guessing, we avoid potentially registering something incorrectly that could be challenged. And when we do fix something, since we notify relevant parties (and possibly require their input if needed), we keep everyone on the same page.
- Efficiency: Minor typos can be fixed quickly without restarting a whole application, which is efficient, but only in truly minor cases. For bigger issues, yes it causes delay (getting new signatures, etc.), but that delay is necessary to avoid legal risk. Overall, the policy saves time by defining boundaries – staff won’t waste time agonizing over if they should allow a change; they have a policy to follow.
- User Guidance: It will encourage applicants to be careful. If they know MSLR will bounce their form if it has un-initialed changes or serious errors, they’ll hopefully prepare documents more meticulously. It’s part of raising the standard as we modernize (which ties into Policy 7 on completeness as well).
- Record-keeping: In the past, some changes might have been made with a pen and not well recorded. Now we formalize it: any alteration or correction is either documented on the instrument or through a separate notice. That becomes part of the record, which future examiners can see. For instance, if 10 years later someone wonders “Why does the registry show this interest ended on June 1 instead of June 2 as in original document?”, they can find a correction notice explaining a typo was fixed. This transparency prevents confusion down the line.
Policy 15 – MSLR Counter Service
Date of Original Approval: October 1, 2009
Last Updated: July 25, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: Since inception, the Land Registry office provided significant in-person assistance to Settlement members – helping fill forms, providing guidance on land transfers, even witnessing signatures. This was useful in early years when Settlements were adjusting to the new regime. However, by 2009, it was recognized that this blurred the lines of responsibility and could conflict with roles (e.g., registry staff inadvertently giving advice that should come from a Settlement or legal advisor)[49][50]. A 2009 directive (Policy #15 then) refocused MSLR as a registry only, not an advisory or document preparation service[51][52]. Now in 2025, with digital self-service tools, it’s even more feasible to maintain that stance, while ensuring members still get the help they need through appropriate channels (Settlement offices, help resources).
Policy Statements:
- Information vs. Advisory: MSLR counter staff (or phone support staff) will provide information and guidance on process, but will not provide legal advice or fill out documents on behalf of clients. They can explain what a form is for, what fields it has, and what supporting documents are required, but they must not tell someone “you should put X here” in a way that constitutes advice or decide things for them. For example, staff can say “This is where the transferee’s name goes,” but not “You should add your son as joint tenant here” – the latter is advice.
- Referral to Settlement Offices: If a member or client needs help beyond basic questions – such as drafting a will for land, deciding how to structure a transfer, or resolving membership matters – MSLR will refer them to their Settlement Land Clerk or Council (or MSGC if appropriate)[53][54]. Settlement offices are better positioned to either assist directly or guide the person to professional services. The idea is one-stop at the community: members first seek help locally, and only come to MSLR for the actual registration function.
- Document Acceptance at Counter: MSLR will accept for processing any complete, duly authorized document presented at the counter (or via portal). If someone walks in with a signed transfer that has all required signatures and approvals, staff will process it. However, if the document is incomplete or requires a council approval that’s missing, staff will not fix it for them on the spot; they will hand it back with instructions to obtain the missing elements (consistent with Policy 7)[55][56]. MSLR staff will also commission documents for individuals if needed – e.g., they can act as Commissioner for Oaths to witness a signature on a form, as long as the person signing presents ID and is the person they claim[57][58]. What they cannot do is sign as a witness to the content (like cannot be the witness on a settlement membership application which implies endorsing something, as that’s outside their role).
- Membership Questions: Any questions about membership eligibility or application procedures will be directed away from MSLR. Those are political/governance matters for Settlements and MSGC. For instance, if someone asks “How do I get membership in Settlement X?”, MSLR will tell them to contact that Settlement’s council or membership committee, not provide advice or steps aside from perhaps giving them the contact info.
- Digital Self-Service Encouragement: The counter will encourage use of the Digital Portal. If a person comes in and needs to do a common task (say submit a land transfer), staff might show them how to do it on a public kiosk or their device via the portal, rather than purely paper. This empowers the user and over time reduces reliance on in-person visits for routine queries.
- Professional Courtesy: MSLR will maintain a friendly, helpful counter presence – the intent is not to “turn people away,” but to channel their needs appropriately. Staff will have a list of resources (Settlement contacts, legal aid contacts if needed, etc.) to give to clients who need more than the registry can offer. The focus is on being helpful within our mandate and not overstepping.
Implementation:
- Staff Training & Scripts: Train counter staff on where the line is between guidance and advice. Provide example scenarios and even scripted language. E.g., If someone says “Can you help me fill this out?”, staff might respond “I can explain what information each field is asking for, but I can’t fill it in for you. Let’s go through it together and I’ll let you know what needs to go where.” That way the person fills it themselves but doesn’t feel unsupported. Or if someone asks “Should I add my child to the title?”, staff should know to say “That’s a decision for you and perhaps your council or legal advisor; I can’t advise on that. I can tell you how it would be done if you decide to.”
- Printed/Online Materials: Develop clear instruction sheets and FAQ handouts that can be given at the counter or downloadable. Often people ask for help because they don’t have clear instructions. If we provide a guidebook (deliverable 5) or pamphlets, staff can use those as tools: “Here’s a checklist the Settlement and MSLR put together on how to do a land transfer.” This enables self-help.
- Commissioner Services: Ensure enough staff are Commissioners for Oaths so that one is usually available to witness signatures or administer oaths for statutory declarations, etc. Post the ID requirements for commissioning (so people bring proper ID). Maintain a log of documents commissioned as per regulations (this is often required by law). Make it clear this is a courtesy to facilitate transactions, not an endorsement of content.
- Office Setup: The physical layout can encourage self-service. For example, have a computer kiosk in the lobby for portal access, with perhaps a staff member or student co-op available to guide users on it. Over time, members might just come to use the kiosk (if they don’t have internet at home) and do it themselves.
- Communications: Inform Settlement councils that MSLR is reinforcing this policy, so they know to gear up their capacity. If settlements fear they’ll get more inquiries as a result, maybe we coordinate to ensure they have updated info and forms. Possibly host a short training with Settlement clerks so they know what to expect (they likely are aware since 2009, but a refresher can’t hurt).
- Feedback Mechanism: Provide a way for clients to give feedback. If someone feels they didn’t get enough help, that’s important to address. Maybe the issue is unclear instructions rather than staff unwillingness. Use such feedback to improve our materials or clarify policies further.
Impacts:
- Role Clarity: MSLR’s core function as a neutral registry is solidified. By not entangling in advisory roles, we reduce liability and potential conflicts of interest. For example, if MSLR staff helped fill a form incorrectly, the member could blame MSLR. Now that risk is mitigated by having them or their representatives take responsibility for content.
- Empowerment: Over time, members and Settlement administrations become more self-reliant in handling transactions. Settlement Land Clerks might enhance their services, possibly offering workshops or drop-in help for their members in response. This local empowerment is beneficial – decisions and advice rest with the community structures.
- Efficiency: MSLR can focus on processing documents swiftly rather than spending hours with individuals on paperwork. This likely improves turnaround times for registrations. However, initially, some clients may feel frustrated if they expected full service. Managing that expectation through communication and showing them alternative support (like “your Settlement office can help you with that part”) is key.
- Digital Transition: Pushing people towards the portal (with guidance) accelerates digital adoption. Many will find it convenient once they try, reducing future counter visits for status updates or submissions. Also, portal usage inherently prevents incomplete submissions by prompting required fields, aligning with our other policies.
- Consistent with Policy History: This continues the 2009 directive effectively[51][59], updated for today. Past risk assessments likely flagged registry staff getting too involved in membership processes as inappropriate[50][54]. We adhere to that correction.
- Community Governance: Deferring membership and some land guidance to Settlement councils reinforces local governance autonomy. Councils often have their own membership or lands committees – those bodies should be the ones advising members on ramifications of land deals (like ensuring council approvals). MSLR stepping back a bit encourages those local systems to function as intended under the MSA (where Settlements govern land allocation and membership).
- Public Perception: We must ensure this doesn’t come off as “MSLR won’t help you anymore.” It should be seen as “MSLR is modernizing and focusing on being an efficient registry, while still ensuring you get the help you need from the right place.” If executed well, the public will still feel supported, just in a more structured way.
Policy 16 – Digital Portal Access and Security
Date of Original Approval: January 1, 2025
Reviewed and Approved by MSLR Registrar: ________
Context: The launch of the MSLR Digital Portal marks a major modernization milestone. It allows members, Settlements, and others to conduct registry business online 24/7. However, with this convenience comes the imperative of robust security, especially given past concerns about data integrity and unauthorized access risks in legacy systems[2][21]. This policy sets the requirements for user access to the portal and overall system security measures to protect sensitive information and prevent any breaches or data corruption.
Policy Statements:
- User Account Requirements: Every user of the MSLR Portal must register for an account with verified identity and role. For Settlement members, this means providing personal identification (such as government-issued ID) and a verification that they are indeed that member (which could be cross-checked against the Members List or via Settlement administration). For staff of Settlements or MSGC, accounts must be approved by the Registrar or an admin delegate, ensuring only authorized officials get elevated access (like to see multiple records). Government users similarly need their department to vouch for them. No generic or shared accounts are allowed; each individual user must have their own credentials for accountability[60][21].
- Authentication: The portal will enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all logins[60][21]. This typically will be a password plus a second factor like a one-time code via SMS or an authenticator app. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access via leaked passwords. Additionally, higher-privilege users (like MSLR staff or Settlement clerks) may be required to use even stronger methods (e.g., a physical token or biometric, if available).
- Session Security: User sessions will timeout after a period of inactivity (for instance, 15 minutes) to prevent someone inadvertently staying logged in on a shared computer[61][62]. Users will be required to log in again to continue. Also, the system will have intrusion detection – if there are multiple failed login attempts or unusual access patterns (like user logging in from two distant locations in short time), it will trigger alerts and potentially lock the account pending verification[62][63].
- Access Control & Least Privilege: Users only see and do what their role permits (reinforcing Policy 6’s privacy protection). For example, a regular member can only see their own records and submit transactions for themselves; they cannot search other members’ info. A Settlement Land Clerk can see data for their Settlement’s lands and members, but not other settlements. Any attempt to access beyond privileges will be blocked and logged. The system is built on a “least privilege” principle – give the minimum access needed for the job.
- Audit Logging: The portal/system will keep a detailed audit log of all activities: logins, data views, submissions, approvals, changes, etc.[64][65]. These logs include who did what and when. They are immutable (cannot be altered by normal users) to serve as a reliable record in case of disputes or security reviews.
- System Monitoring: Unauthorized access attempts (e.g., a person trying to access something they shouldn’t, or an external hacking attempt) will trigger alerts to MSLR IT administrators in real-time[62][63]. MSLR will have monitoring tools in place to watch for anomalies (unusually high usage at odd hours, repeated queries that might indicate data scraping, etc.). There will also be periodic security audits and penetration tests performed by independent experts to validate the system’s defenses[66].
- Data Protection: All portal communications are encrypted (HTTPS). Sensitive personal data in the database is encrypted at rest too. Regular backups are done, and the disaster recovery site (second data center) stands ready, which protects against data loss or ransomware (we can restore from clean backups if needed). These steps directly address the risk of data corruption/loss identified earlier[1][2].
- User Training and Responsibilities: All users will have access to a “Portal User Guide” which includes basic security hygiene (choose strong passwords, don’t share credentials, log out when done, etc.). MSLR will also incorporate some user education in the portal (like short reminders or even a required short tutorial for first-time users). Users must agree to terms of use which include respecting privacy and using the system only for lawful, intended purposes. Any misuse may result in account suspension.
- Continuous Improvement: This policy and the security setup will be reviewed at least annually or whenever a new risk is identified (whichever comes first). The policy acknowledges that cyber threats evolve, and MSLR will update its security measures accordingly, perhaps in consultation with GoA’s central IT security or external advisers.
Implementation:
- Account Verification Process: Set up a workflow for verifying new accounts. Possibly, for members: an integration with MyAlberta Digital ID could be used to verify identity online. Or MSLR could do a verification by sending a code to the member’s address on file. For officials: maintain a list of authorized personnel provided by each Settlement (so if John Doe signs up claiming to be Gift Lake Land Clerk, we check against the official letter from Gift Lake naming their clerk).
- System Configuration: Ensure the chosen software platform supports MFA and role-based permissions, etc. These likely have been built in as part of system development (the ARLO model presumably had these features we are adapting). Have our IT staff or vendor configure the monitoring and alerts (intrusion detection systems, etc.). Also establish an incident response plan: e.g., if a breach attempt is detected, who is notified (probably IR Ministry IT, MSLR head, etc.), and what steps to take (like temporarily shutting off external access if needed until resolved).
- Testing: Before full launch, conduct penetration testing (ethical hacking) to find any weaknesses. Also load testing to ensure the system doesn’t behave weirdly under stress that might open holes. Address findings.
- User Guide & Support: Develop the Portal User Guide (which is part of deliverable 5 possibly) focusing on security tips as well. Provide a helpdesk contact for any user who suspects their account was compromised or has other security concerns (like “I left my account logged in at a library, what do I do?” answer: contact us to force logoff all sessions and change password).
- Updates and Patches: Implement a maintenance schedule for applying security patches to the system software. All too often breaches happen when systems aren’t updated. Since the data is sensitive, we will treat security updates with high priority.
- Legal Compliance: Ensure our processes comply with privacy laws (we might need a Privacy Impact Assessment, which likely was done). The audit logs containing user activity are themselves sensitive to a degree, so they should only be accessed by security admins when needed.
- Communication to Users: Roll out information campaign to trust the portal: highlight the security features (“Your data is safe – we use MFA, encryption, etc.”). This will help alleviate fears some members might have about moving from paper to digital.
Impacts:
- Risk Mitigation: This directly tackles the known enterprise risks – by enforcing strict access and monitoring, the chance of unauthorized data access or corruption is vastly reduced[2][67]. For example, even if someone’s password got guessed, MFA stops the attacker. And if some glitch tried to change data, our logs and backups catch it. These measures together ensure the registry’s integrity and availability, even more so than the old offline system (which ironically could be changed by an insider with less trace).
- User Accountability: Because each user has their own account and everything is logged, users are likely to be more responsible. A Settlement clerk knows if they look up someone they shouldn’t, it’s recorded. This deters casual snooping or any fraudulent attempts, aligning with our privacy commitment[68][23].
- Confidence in Modernization: Stakeholders (provincial government, MSGC, members) will see that the new digital system is not a security liability but actually an improvement in safeguarding records. That helps build support for continued digitization. It also positions MSLR as on par with Land Titles in terms of security (which is important if down the road systems interlink more).
- Incident Preparedness: If something does go wrong (e.g., a virus attack or insider misuse), we will be in a better position to respond and recover because of these controls. That reduces downtime and impact. E.g., daily backups plus replication means even a server crash or hack can be rolled back with minimal data loss.
- User Convenience vs Security: There’s always a balance – some users might initially find MFA or frequent logins annoying. But given the sensitivity of land records, it’s justified. Good communication and making the process as smooth as possible (like allowing authenticator apps for MFA rather than solely SMS if cell coverage is an issue in some areas) will help user acceptance. Over time, as people get used to online banking with MFA, etc., they’ll accept it here too.
- Continuous Trust: The emphasis on continuous audits and updates means we won’t get complacent. The registry will adapt to new threats. This dynamic approach is necessary because what’s secure today might not be tomorrow (e.g., new hacking techniques). By stating it in policy, we commit to staying vigilant.
________________________________________
(The above Policy Book is the final integrated version, consolidating statutory requirements, historical directives (2005–2014 “MSLR Extra” content), MSGC policies, and new digital standards as of 2025. All policies are numbered for easy reference. This replaces any previous policy guides. Statutory references: MSA – Metis Settlements Act; MSLR Regulation – Alta. Reg. 361/1991 and amendments; MSGC Land Policy – most recent consolidated version. Implementations and Impacts sections are provided to guide understanding and rollout, and do not override the Policy Statements.)**
Implementation Plan for the Modernized MSLR Policy Framework
Implementing the above policies and modernized system is a significant undertaking. A structured, phased approach will ensure a smooth transition from the current state to the fully modernized MSLR, while mitigating risks identified earlier (data integrity, statutory compliance, etc.). Below is the comprehensive Implementation Plan with key phases, actions, and risk mitigation measures:
Phase 1: Preparation and Audit (Q3 2025 – Q4 2025)
1. Project Governance and Team Setup: Establish an implementation steering committee with representatives from MSLR (Registrar’s office), Metis Settlements General Council, a Settlement Administrator rep, Indigenous Relations ministry IT, and possibly MSAT (for appeal process input). This team will oversee the rollout, manage scope, and address any inter-agency issues. Also assign a project manager internally to coordinate day-to-day tasks.
2. Policy Finalization and Training Materials: Now that the Policy Book is finalized, present it to key stakeholders (Indigenous Relations leadership, MSGC) for buy-in. Develop training materials for different audiences: - Detailed internal training for MSLR staff on the new policies and system features. - Overview sessions for Settlement Council members and land clerks, focusing on changes relevant to them (e.g., their new role in helping members rather than MSLR doing so much, how to use the portal for approvals, etc.). - Member-friendly explanations (to be used in guidebook and info sessions).
3. Audit of Legacy Records: Conduct a thorough audit of existing registry data and documents[1][3]. This includes: - Data Integrity Check: Verify digital records against paper files to catch any discrepancies (e.g., ensure all active land interests in files are in the database accurately). Pay special attention to known problematic areas: expired PMTs that might not have been canceled properly (use “inactive interest” list to find those), old allocations (as discussed in Policy 12), and any interests that lack proper survey or description. - Members List Review: Coordinate with each Settlement to confirm their membership list matches MSLR’s records, resolving any differences (this addresses compliance and ensures a clean start for secure access controls). - Scan and Digitize Paper Records: Any critical documents that exist only on paper (old survey plans, historical policy directives, etc.) should be scanned and attached to digital records so that the new system has a complete digital archive. This contributes to data integrity and access ease.
Risk Mitigation: The audit mitigates the risk of carrying forward errors into the new system. We will document any irregularities found (e.g., an interest that should have been canceled but wasn’t) and take corrective action before those records are migrated to the new digital platform. If certain corrections require legal steps (e.g., need an MSAT order to formally cancel something), we will initiate those in this phase as well. This directly addresses statutory compliance gaps by fixing them upfront.
4. Technical Infrastructure Setup: Work with IT to set up the staging environment for the MSLR Digital Portal. In Phase 1, the focus is on ensuring all hardware, networking, and security infrastructure is in place: - Secure servers (production and backup) provisioned. - Security measures (firewalls, encryption, MFA system, intrusion detection) configured in accordance with Policy 16. - Migration scripts or tools ready for importing legacy data post-audit.
5. Communication and Change Management: Early communication is key to stakeholder buy-in. In this phase, send out communications to: - Settlement Councils and Administrations: Outline what’s coming (new policies, new system), the timeline, and how it benefits them (e.g., faster processing, better data security). Emphasize their role in success, such as participating in training and encouraging members to adapt. - Members (General Public): Possibly via MSGC or Settlement newsletters and social media – announce that a new “Land Registry system” will launch in 2026. Highlight features (online access, clarity of rules) and assure that their data is secure. Provide a high-level timeline when certain services might be temporarily unavailable (if any downtime needed for cutover). - Provincial Agencies: Inform Alberta Justice/Aboriginal Relations colleagues, since some legal processes or references might change (e.g., new forms, MSAT appeals might have slight process changes). Ensuring external stakeholders know the registry is being modernized prevents confusion.
This phase ends with all groundwork laid: a clean set of records, informed stakeholders, and technical pieces ready to integrate.
Phase 2: System Rollout and Training (Q1 2026 – Q4 2026)
1. Data Migration and System Go-Live (Pilot): With the audited clean data, perform a migration into the new Digital Portal system. Before full launch, do a pilot rollout: - Select two Metis Settlements (perhaps one larger, one smaller) to pilot the new system for a defined period (3-4 months). During this pilot, those Settlement offices will use the digital portal for all new transactions and members in those communities will be invited to use the system (with assistance). - MSLR staff will run both the legacy and new systems in parallel for those pilot settlements to ensure nothing is lost (dual entry if needed, or at least keeping old system updated as backup). - Gather feedback from pilot users: Was the portal easy? Did any policy confusion arise? Use metrics (like how many submissions were done online vs. in-person, error rates, etc.) to gauge success.
Risk Mitigation: Pilot approach mitigates the risk of a system failure or major issue impacting all 8 settlements. We can catch technical glitches or user experience problems on a smaller scale and adjust before full deployment. It also allows refining training if we discover certain concepts weren’t well understood initially.
2. Full Training Rollout: Based on pilot experience, finalize training and roll it out to all: - MSLR Staff Training: Ensure every registry staff fully understands the new policies and system. This may involve formal workshops and hands-on practice in a test environment. Include training on the Implementation of policies – e.g., how to use the checklist for incomplete submissions (Policy 7), how to handle an objection in the system (Policy 3), etc. They should also learn the new security protocols (Policy 16) and escalation procedures (like what to do if an unauthorized attempt is flagged). - Settlement Staff Training: Conduct regional training sessions for Settlement Land Clerks and administrators. These can be in-person (at a central location or at each Settlement) or via webinar if needed. Training covers: - Using the Digital Portal from a Settlement perspective (approving transactions, running reports, verifying member info). - Their responsibilities under new policies: e.g., no more relying on MSLR to draft documents (Policy 15), need to ensure subdivision before sending partial transfers (Policy 1), involvement in renewal/cancellation of PMTs (Policy 4). - Emphasizing how the changes benefit them – e.g., quicker turnaround, more transparency (they can see status of submissions online now, not send and pray). - Provide printed quick-guides and the Policy Book for their reference. - Member Outreach/Education: While not every member will take formal training, we will schedule community information sessions at each Settlement (perhaps piggybacking on community meetings) to showcase the new system. Demonstrate the portal on a projector: how to log in, how to check your land holdings, how to submit an application. Distribute the MSLR User Guidebook (from deliverable 5, discussed later) to attendees and have it available at settlement offices. Also, local radio or community Facebook pages can be used for short informational messages (“Need to renew your land interest? You can now do it online! Come to a demo at the office on [date]”).
Risk Mitigation: Comprehensive training and outreach mitigate the risk of user resistance or errors due to unfamiliarity. By involving Settlement staff heavily, we ensure capacity at the front line (since members will often go to them with questions). The guidebook and help resources address the risk of non-compliance or confusion by giving clear instructions (which was a problem historically – unclear process led to mistakes[3]). Also, engagement and showing benefits will mitigate risk of pushback (“we liked the old way”) by illustrating improvements and addressing concerns (some may worry digital means losing control, so reassure via showing security and that Settlement still approves things, etc.).
3. Phased Go-Live (All Settlements): After the pilot is refined, roll out the system to all remaining Settlements in phases: - Group the remaining six Settlements into two groups of three (for example). Go-live for Group 1 in Q3 2026, Group 2 in Q4 2026. This staggering means our team can concentrate support for a few at a time. - During each go-live, have “hyper-care” support: extra MSLR staff on phones or even on-site to assist with any hiccups. Monitor the system’s performance and any user issue logs closely in the first few weeks. - Old paper-based processes: Determine a cutoff date after which all new submissions must go through the new process/policies. Likely, on go-live, we’d say any new transaction must use new forms and comply with new policy. There might be some legacy transactions initiated before go-live still in pipeline; handle those on a case-by-case (we might grandfather them through old system if close to finish, or help them transition to new forms). - Ensure the automatic features are working: e.g., the 90-day/60-day expiry notices (Policy 2) should start generating. We will verify the first batch of those letters for correctness. Objection portal should be tested with a real case if possible. These operational checks ensure each policy’s implementation is functioning as intended.
Risk Mitigation: Phasing prevents overload. We also mitigate risk by maintaining contingency plans: The old system/database won’t be fully retired until we are confident in the new one – essentially a backup plan if something goes seriously wrong, we could revert to old process temporarily. Having on-site support mitigates the risk of settlements struggling alone and maybe doing workarounds that undermine policy (like if they can’t figure portal, they might try to bypass – having support prevents that). We also continue broad communication so everyone knows exactly when their settlement transitions to avoid trying to use old forms after cutoff, etc.
4. Monitor and Adjust: Through Phase 2, hold bi-weekly implementation team meetings to discuss: - User feedback coming in (are members complaining about any requirement? Are clerks noticing frequent deficiencies?). - Any technical bugs or slower-than-expected processes. - Compliance observations: e.g., have incomplete submissions truly dropped to near-zero because of the portal checks? If any policy isn’t yielding expected results, note it. - Risk logs: Update any risk assessment – e.g., if a new cyber threat emerges during this time, ensure our security posture is updated (Policy 16’s continuous improvement). - Stakeholder morale: Are people frustrated or are things smooth? For instance, if Settlement councils are inundated with members asking for help because they find forms confusing, we might respond by simplifying forms or adding more help pop-ups in portal.
This monitoring allows mid-course tweaks. Perhaps we need to extend hyper-care support longer for some communities, or provide refresher training on a specific policy.
By end of Phase 2 (end of 2026), the goal is that all Settlements and MSLR staff are using the new system and policies for current operations, and the old registry system is decommissioned (or at least read-only for archival info). The new Policy Book is in full effect.
Phase 3: Stabilization and Ongoing Support (2027 and beyond)
1. Post-Implementation Audit (Q1 2027): Conduct an internal audit or evaluation of the first few months of full operation: - Review a sample of transactions to ensure they complied with new policies (e.g., check a batch of PMT renewals to see if any post-expiry were incorrectly accepted—hopefully none[69]). - Verify data integrity in live environment: no unexplained discrepancies, all logs in place. - Ensure that high-risk items identified in ERM are indeed addressed: for example, confirm that backup/disaster recovery works by doing a simulation (take a backup and restore it to test system to see if data comes through), check audit logs of access to confirm no unauthorized access occurred (or if occurred, it was caught)[60][62]. - Solicit formal feedback from each Settlement: did the modernization solve the pain points? Any lingering issues? This can be done via a structured survey or meeting.
Any findings should be resolved with corrective actions. If a policy needs minor adjustment (perhaps a clarification) or if the system needs a patch, plan those out.
2. Embedding Continuous Training and Support: By 2027, regular operations resume but with continuous support: - Include MSLR system/policy orientation in onboarding for any new Settlement clerks or MSLR staff (since staff turnover can erode knowledge). - Keep the helpdesk support for portal users permanent during business hours – members might still call with questions, and we should maintain customer service. - Possibly hold an annual “MSLR workshop” at MSGC or so to refresh on policies, share any updates (if legislation changes or if MSGC Land Policy changes, incorporate those).
3. Ongoing Stakeholder Engagement: - Schedule annual check-ins with each Settlement council to ensure the registry is meeting their needs. This also strengthens relations and allows them to voice any new requests (maybe they want a new report type from system, etc.). - Continue to coordinate with MSAT: since appeals may arise from our decisions, having a feedback loop is good. E.g., if MSAT notices many appeals on a certain issue, maybe the policy needs clarification or more user education.
4. Evaluate and Mitigate Long-term Risks: The modernization should drastically reduce prior high risks, but new ones may appear (like evolving cybersecurity threats, or emerging issues like climate events affecting data centers, etc.). Incorporate MSLR into the Ministry’s Enterprise Risk Management so that it’s regularly assessed. For any remaining moderate risks (say, reliance on internet connectivity in remote settlements), consider mitigation – e.g., ensure there’s an offline contingency for times when a Settlement’s internet is down (perhaps allow temporary paper and then sync later).
5. Success Measures and Reporting: Develop KPIs to measure success of implementation, for example: - Average processing time for common transactions (should improve compared to 2024 baseline). - Number of incomplete submissions (should drop significantly, ideally near zero). - User satisfaction surveys (members and Settlement staff). - Reduction in registry errors or complaints (monitor how many objection cases or appeals occur; if policies working, avoidable issues drop). - Data security incidents (hopefully none; measure that we’ve had zero breaches).
Prepare a report in mid-2027 for Indigenous Relations management and MSGC summarizing these successes or any outstanding issues. This could help justify continued support and showcase the value of the modernization (which can be useful for budget sustainment and showing the Business Plan objectives were met).
Phased Approach Summary:
•	Phase 1: Clean house and line up the ducks. We mitigate historical issues and prep everyone.
•	Phase 2: Introduce new system carefully with lots of training. We mitigate change management risks by not big-banging it, and ensure people can adapt.
•	Phase 3: Institutionalize the improvements. We mitigate the risk of backslide or new issues by regular auditing, training, and communication, making the modernization stick.
Throughout all phases, risk mitigation is explicitly addressed: - Data integrity risk is handled by audits and backups. - Outdated system risk is gone with new system but we keep it updated (patches, support). - Statutory compliance gaps are closed by implementing the policies to the letter and double-checking via audit and MSAT oversight. - We also mitigate human factors (the best system fails if people don’t use it right) by heavy emphasis on training, support, and gradually building comfort.
This Implementation Plan is realistic and phased over roughly 2+ years (late 2025 through 2027). It is resource-intensive at first, but by the end of 2027, the system should be running smoothly as part of routine operations, with governance for continual improvement in place.
Budget Proposal (2025–2028)
Implementing the Modernized MSLR Policy Book and digital system will require a multi-year budget commitment. Below is a breakdown of the budget by fiscal year and by major function, aligned with the Government of Alberta Indigenous Relations Business Plan 2025–28 and tapping into possible funding sources such as the Aboriginal Business Investment Fund (ABIF) and Community Support Fund (CSF). The budget is designed to be feasible (cost-effective and staged with progress) and compelling (showing clear outcomes and alignment with strategic funding priorities).
Summary of Budget Needs (2025–2028): We anticipate the total budget required over 4 fiscal years to be approximately $2.5 million, allocated as detailed below. We will leverage internal resources, existing capital where possible, and targeted grants for specific components. All figures are in Canadian dollars.
2025–26 (Year 1) – Planning and Initial Development
•	Records Audit and Cleanup: $150,000 – This covers hiring temporary project staff or contractors to assist with the legacy data audit, scanning of documents, and data migration prep. It also includes some legal consulting fees to advise on tricky compliance fixes (e.g., reviewing which old interests need formal cancellation). This portion can be funded from the department’s operational budget (justified as risk mitigation work to protect data integrity) – a modest cost for a critical foundation.
•	Digital System Development: $500,000 – Initial costs to configure or customize the digital portal (assuming we are adapting an existing platform like ARLO). This covers software licensing, developer time to implement MSLR-specific features (like the Objection module, integration with MSGC Land Policy rules, etc.), and hardware setup (servers, backup storage). We propose to seek ABIF grant funding for a part of this, since it is essentially an infrastructure upgrade that will support community economic outcomes (efficient land registry aids investment)[70][71]. For example, we could apply for $300k from ABIF (the grant can cover up to $750k for community infrastructure[72][71]) to go toward the digital platform. The remaining $200k would be Ministry capital budget or IM/IT funds, already earmarked in the Business Plan for registry modernization.
•	Policy Development and Training Design: $100,000 – This covers engaging a legal expert to final review the integrated Policy Book, printing/distributing the policy manuals, and developing training curricula (including maybe hiring a training consultant to help create e-learning modules for the portal). Possibly fundable via Indigenous Capacity Support initiatives or CSF if framed as training that improves governance capacity (though CSF has specific social outcomes focus). Alternatively, incorporate into the Ministry’s operational spending for Metis Settlements governance (since it directly addresses governance and compliance gaps).
•	Project Management and Contingency: $50,000 – Allocate for a part-time project manager or coordinator and a contingency for unforeseen small costs in Year 1. This ensures the project stays on track and minor scope changes or equipment needs don’t derail it.
Total 2025–26: $800,000.
Funding Sources: Approximately $300k from ABIF (for system dev)[70], potential $50k from CSF (if training aspects qualify under improving community outcomes), and $450k from Indigenous Relations core budget (justified under the Business Plan outcome of “Modernize Metis Settlements governance and administration” which presumably has some allocated funds).
2026–27 (Year 2) – Implementation and Rollout
•	System Deployment and Licensing: $200,000 – Additional costs for full deployment across all Settlements: this includes any further software license fees for new user accounts, cloud hosting fees for the portal, and minor feature enhancements discovered in pilot. By now, major dev is done, so costs are lower, mainly operational IT costs.
•	Equipment for Settlements: $120,000 – Provide each Settlement Office with updated IT equipment to access and use the system effectively: e.g., secure computers or tablets for clerks, a public kiosk or two for members to use at the office, scanners for digitizing incoming paper. Budget about $15k per Settlement x 8 = $120k. We will seek capital funding support for this, possibly through the Capital projects in the Indigenous Relations budget or even a follow-up ABIF if needed (though ABIF is more business project oriented, this is more governmental, so likely internal capital funding).
•	Training Delivery: $80,000 – Travel and facilitation for on-site training at 8 settlements, plus materials production (posters, quick-guides, etc.), and potentially stipends for “super-users” or local assistants during rollout. Could incorporate a portion into the Community Support Fund if we frame it as improving community capacity (CSF grants up to $100k have been given for community-led training programs[73], though CSF is geared to social outcomes, we could emphasize how improved land governance contributes to community well-being and safety, albeit it's a slight stretch. More reliably, we use ministry operational funds for training).
•	Change Management & Communication: $50,000 – Public awareness campaigns, possibly contracting a communications specialist to create user-friendly videos or help center content for the portal. Also covering any community events (with refreshments etc. to encourage attendance) during outreach. This relatively small investment ensures user uptake. Could potentially tap into CSF if packaged as community engagement for economic participation.
•	Staffing for Implementation Support: $180,000 – For the rollout year, fund 2-3 temporary implementation support positions (or secondments): e.g., a technical support specialist, a community liaison (to handle feedback and assist Settlement offices), and a data analyst to monitor metrics. Salary & benefits for one year: ~ $60k each. This ensures adequate hand-holding during the transition. This is likely to be covered by internal reallocation or perhaps an “innovation fund” within the ministry. It aligns with the Business Plan’s priority of improving service delivery, justifying internal funding.
•	Contingency: $70,000 – Roughly 10% of the above for unexpected needs in rollout (for example, extended pilot if issues arise, or additional support for a community facing challenges). Unused contingency can be returned or rolled into next year.
Total 2026–27: $700,000.
Funding Sources: Mainly Indigenous Relations core modernization budget. We will attempt about $100k from CSF (for training/engagement) by highlighting outcomes like “increased capacity and safety of transactions for community members”[74]. The rest (~$600k) likely comes from the ministry’s Transformation or IM/IT funds already allocated to digital initiatives (the Business Plan presumably included a line for MSLR modernization, we align to that). If needed, a small top-up from ABIF could be considered if some component qualifies (though ABIF is more capital; by this year we’d mostly use internal funding).
2027–28 (Year 3) – Stabilization and Optimization
•	Operational Support & Maintenance: $100,000 – Ongoing costs for software maintenance, security monitoring services, and helpdesk operations. This is the year where the system becomes part of regular ops. These costs will transition to the department’s operating budget for MSLR IT. Possibly reduced by any cost-sharing with the Land Titles ARLO system if maintenance can be piggybacked.
•	Additional Enhancements: $50,000 – Based on Phase 3 review, implement any needed improvements or new features (e.g., if user feedback demands a mobile app interface or more reporting capability). This small fund can also cover integration tweaks (say linking to MSAT’s system or provincial open data for parcels) to maximize interoperability. Could be partly funded by any innovation grants or simply by internal IT budget given the small scale.
•	Continued Training & Capacity Building: $30,000 – Budget for refresher workshops, production of any new guidebook editions, and on-boarding training for any new staff in Settlements or MSLR. By now, this might fall under routine HR/training budget lines, but we earmark to ensure knowledge transfer remains strong and to possibly develop an online learning module for future use (one-time cost).
•	Community Engagement & Feedback Loop: $20,000 – Organize a Metis Settlements Land Registry Forum (perhaps in collaboration with MSGC) post-implementation to gather feedback and share best practices. Could include travel for reps from all settlements. This demonstrates continued engagement and can be rolled into MSGC’s budget if they agree, or financed by IR as part of stakeholder relations.
Total 2027–28: $200,000.
Funding Sources: These are mostly ongoing operational expenses. By Year 3, Indigenous Relations should incorporate these into its base budget (less reliant on one-time grants). The relatively low amount is sustainable within existing envelopes (for example, $100k for IT maintenance can be offset by retiring old system costs, and training $30k can be in professional development budgets).
2028–29 and beyond – Sustaining (for context, not explicitly requested):
After 2028, the system should yield cost savings (e.g., less paper handling, fewer manual corrections). The budget will normalize to primarily IT maintenance (~$100k/yr) and staffing the registry (which is already an existing cost center). We expect the modernization to be cost-neutral or positive in the long run due to efficiency (staff can handle more volume or other tasks with same resources).
Alignment with Business Plan and Funding Vehicles:
The Indigenous Relations Business Plan 2025–28 likely emphasizes improved governance, digital transformation, and supporting Indigenous community infrastructure. This project checks all those boxes: - It addresses critical risk (so supports the key performance measure of risk reduction). - It modernizes service delivery (contributing to GoA’s digital government initiative). - It empowers communities (members and local councils) in managing their lands, aligning with self-governance and reconciliation objectives.
ABIF (Aboriginal Business Investment Fund): As noted, we plan to use ABIF for the front-loaded infrastructure costs. ABIF’s goal is to fund economic infrastructure for Indigenous communities[70]. A modern land registry, while not a business per se, directly facilitates economic development (clear land title and efficient transactions attract investment and enable business projects on settlements). We will craft the ABIF application to emphasize: - The project is community-owned (MSGC and settlements collectively “own” the registry). - It upgrades infrastructure (digital platform, equipment) needed for long-term viability. - It leads to jobs indirectly (by making land available faster for development, reducing red tape, etc.). This should make it a competitive proposal for ABIF’s $10M annual budget earmarked for Indigenous community infrastructure[70]. Even a $300k ABIF grant (well within the $750k cap[72]) offsets a big chunk of cost.
CSF (Community Support Fund): CSF focuses on Indigenous women, girls, 2SLGBTQ+ safety and economic security[74]. While MSLR modernization is broad, we can highlight how improved land governance benefits vulnerable community members (e.g., more transparent processes can reduce conflicts that sometimes lead to community stress, and that women often face barriers in administrative systems – a clearer, accessible registry helps ensure their land rights on equal footing). If we engage Indigenous women in training roles or focus groups for the user experience, we could also tick CSF boxes. We’ve modestly factored maybe $100k from CSF for community engagement and training in Year 2, but this is not certain – we will apply and see, ensuring to tailor our ask to CSF outcomes (like maybe a component to specifically educate women landholders on using the system, tying to CSF’s mandate of improving outcomes for Indigenous women).
Other Funding: - The Business Plan might have internal “transformation funds” or could leverage Technology Innovation funds from Service Alberta since ARLO integration is part of it. We will explore any such sources to reduce pressure on core budget. - If needed, federal support (ISC or Canada’s Indigenous Reconciliation Initiatives) could be tapped for digitization projects. However, given the timeline and mainly provincial jurisdiction, we focus on ABIF/CSF and GoA funds. - Note: The budget also indirectly aligns with the fact that Alberta’s 2025 budget increased ABIF funding to $10M/year[70] – showing GoA’s commitment to Indigenous economic infrastructure. Using a slice of that for MSLR modernization is both feasible and politically positive (government can count it as a success story of ABIF enabling self-reliance infrastructure).
Value for Money and Compelling Narrative:
For roughly $2.5M over 3 years, we: - Eliminate major enterprise risks (prevent costly data loss or legal fights from compliance failures). - Create a digital platform that will serve the Metis Settlements (pop. ~5,000 people) for decades, analogous to the Land Titles system which cost far more for the whole province. - Train local people, building capacity (some funds essentially go into community training and possibly hiring local assistants during rollout). - Ultimately improve economic potential: clearer land titles mean more investment projects can proceed (which ties to broader economic reconciliation aims).
This is a modest investment with high returns in risk reduction and community development. We will articulate these benefits in funding proposals.
Each budget item is tied to outcomes: - E.g., “$120k in IT for settlements ensures no community is left behind digitally – every Settlement has the tools to utilize the new system effectively.” - “$80k in training ensures every clerk and member can confidently use the system, directly contributing to the success of the policy changes by fostering compliance and usage.”
We also demonstrate sustainability: after 2028, maintenance costs are low and mainly internal, not requiring ongoing special funding.
Finally, we’ll include a note that any unspent contingency will be returned or redirected to further enhancing Settlement capacity (so funders see we are prudent and funds will remain in community benefit).
In conclusion, the budget is carefully planned to utilize appropriate funding vehicles for one-time costs (ABIF for infrastructure, CSF for capacity where possible) and rely on base funding for ongoing needs, making it realistic and aligned with governmental funding priorities.
MSLR Staff and Settlement Clerks Guidebook – “Modernized MSLR Policy & Procedures: A Practical Guide”
(A separate, user-friendly guide to help MSLR staff and Settlement land clerks implement the policies on a day-to-day basis, and to assist members in navigating the land registry process. This guidebook distills the policies into instructions, FAQs, and checklists.)
Introduction
Welcome to the Modernized Metis Settlements Land Registry (MSLR) Guidebook. This guide is designed to help MSLR staff and Settlement Land Office clerks understand and apply the new policies and digital procedures in practical scenarios. It will also be a handy reference when assisting Settlement members with land transactions. We cover the essentials of each policy in plain language, walk through common tasks step-by-step, and provide checklists to ensure compliance every time.
How to Use this Guide:
- Section 1: Roles & Responsibilities – Outlines who does what under the new system (members, Settlement offices, MSLR, etc.).
- Section 2: Common Processes – Step-by-step guides for transactions like transfers, PMT renewals, membership terminations, etc., referencing relevant policies.
- Section 3: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) – Quick answers to frequent queries from staff or members (e.g., “What if a member missed the renewal deadline?”).
- Section 4: Checklists – One-page checklists you can use to review submissions (e.g., “Transfer Submission Checklist” ensuring nothing is missing).
- Section 5: Reference – Key contact info, a glossary of terms, and a summary table of policy numbers with one-line descriptions.
This guide emphasizes practical instructions. If legal interpretation is needed, consult the full Policy Book or MSLR Registrar – but for most day-to-day purposes, this guide will keep you on track.
Let’s build confidence together in the modernized system – ensuring accurate, efficient, and fair management of Settlement land records.
________________________________________
Section 1: Roles & Responsibilities in the Modernized MSLR
Under the modernized framework, tasks are shared between members, Settlement offices, and MSLR in a clear way. Here’s a quick overview:
•	Settlement Member (Applicant/Interest Holder): Responsible for initiating requests (filling forms or online submissions), providing complete and accurate information, and meeting any requirements (e.g., getting council approval if needed). Members should keep their contact info updated with the Settlement – especially mailing address for notices.
•	Settlement Land Clerk (and Council where applicable):
•	Guides members on what is needed for their application (e.g., “You want to transfer land to your daughter – you’ll need a council resolution and here’s the form.”).
•	Reviews submissions from members for completeness before forwarding to MSLR – think of the clerk as the first checkpoint. It’s easier to catch an issue at the Settlement office than after sending to MSLR.
•	Handles local approvals: ensuring council resolutions are prepared for things like allotments, subdivision approvals, non-renewals of PMTs, etc.
•	Referrals: If a member needs help beyond process (like legal advice or deciding how to do something), refer them appropriately (e.g., to a lawyer or to council). Do not attempt to give legal advice – that hasn’t changed.
•	In the digital portal, the clerk might also have to validate certain requests (the system may prompt the Settlement to confirm a detail, like verifying a member’s residency for an allocation conversion).
•	Records management: continue maintaining any required local records (like copies of membership applications, local bylaws) and coordinate with MSLR if discrepancies appear.
•	MSLR Staff (Registry Office):
•	Review and register submissions – ensure each request meets policy and either register it or reject with a deficiency notice quickly. They will not “fix” forms for people, so what comes in needs to be in order (Policy 7’s rule).
•	Issue Notices – like 60-day expiry letters or deficiency notices to members, copying Settlement offices where needed.
•	Handle Objections & Appeals – If an objection to cancellation comes in, MSLR logs it, pauses the cancellation, and processes the objection (see Objection process in Section 2).
•	Data upkeep – update the digital system with any changes (like membership terminations triggered by Settlement input, etc.) and ensure backups/audits are happening.
•	Support & Guidance – provide information to Settlement clerks when they have queries about how to apply a policy. MSLR can clarify what a rule means or what’s required, but will stop short of doing the clerk’s tasks.
•	Security & Privacy – enforce the access rules (only authorized folks get info), and guard the system credentials diligently.
•	Metis Settlements General Council (MSGC) / Appeal Bodies:
•	Though not daily users of the system, MSGC Land & Membership Committee may occasionally issue directives or clarify Land Policy aspects; these will be communicated through MSLR if affecting procedure.
•	MSAT (Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal) handles appeals beyond MSLR decisions. Our job is to forward necessary info to MSAT if an appeal is filed. Staff/clerks should be aware of this chain but not play a role in appeals except providing records.
In summary: Members initiate and decide what they want; Settlement clerks verify, assist in process and local authorization; MSLR verifies compliance and executes the registry update. This partnership ensures no one person or level is doing everything, distributing workload and checks and balances.
Tip: When in doubt about who should do something, ask: “Is this about making a decision on land (member/council) or about recording a decision (MSLR)?” – That will usually tell you where it belongs.

Section 2: Common Processes – Step-by-Step Guides
In this section, we break down frequently encountered processes into concrete steps, referencing relevant policy requirements at each stage. Each process is presented first from a Settlement Clerk’s perspective (since you are likely the first point of contact), and notes where MSLR steps in.
2.1 Processing a Land Transfer (Whole interest)
Scenario: A member (Grantor) wants to transfer their Métis Title or PMT to another member (Grantee). For example, a parent giving land to an adult child, or a member selling land to another.
Key Policies: Policy 1 (subdivision needed for partial interests – here we assume it’s the whole parcel, so no subdivision issue), Policy 7 (complete submissions), Policy 15 (MSLR won’t fill forms, but you can guide).
Clerk’s Step-by-Step:
1.	Initial Inquiry: When the member approaches you to transfer, first verify: Is the interest subdivided/defined properly? (If they said “part of my land”, then stop – partial transfer requires prior subdivision per Policy 1. Explain they need to subdivide first.) Assuming it’s entire interest:
2.	Provide Forms & Checklist: Give the member the Land Transfer form (Form MSLR-02, for instance) or direct them to the online portal. Also give them the “Transfer Submission Checklist” from this guide (see checklists in Section 4) so they know everything needed:
3.	Correct legal land description of the interest.
4.	Names and membership numbers of grantor and grantee.
5.	If the Grantee is not currently a Settlement member, they cannot hold land (flag that – they’d need to become a member first).
6.	Council Resolution if required (some Settlements may require council approval for any transfer, though generally not if both parties are members and it’s straightforward – double-check Settlement’s bylaw).
7.	Any spousal consents (Dower form) if applicable (if the grantor is married and it’s a primary residence interest, ensure spouse consents).
8.	Ensure any outstanding mortgages or charges on the interest are dealt with (the registry won’t transfer until those are discharged or the transferee agrees to assume them with proper paperwork).
9.	Assist vs. Advise: You can help the member understand the form sections (“This is where your name goes, this is where the land description goes…”). Do not choose things for them or give advice like “You should add so-and-so as joint tenant” – that’s legal advice. If they are unsure what tenancy arrangement (if applicable) to pick, advise them to seek legal counsel.
If they fill on paper, double-check they filled all fields and signed. If done online, perhaps guide them through the portal submission steps.
1.	Council Involvement: If your Settlement has a requirement (or maybe just a practice) to approve transfers, arrange for the council to pass a resolution, or at least endorse that the transfer aligns with any local land use policy. Many Settlements do not formally approve each transfer, but be aware of local rules. If no formal approval needed, skip this.
2.	Submission to MSLR: Through the Portal – ideally the member or you on their behalf will submit the transfer request. As clerk, you might have to validate that the Grantee is indeed a member (the system likely cross-checks membership ID). Attach scanned copies of any supporting documents (e.g., signed transfer form if they filled offline, spousal consent form, council resolution if any).
Check one more time the submission is complete. Use the checklist: - Both parties signed? Yes. - Proper ID of land (matches registry records exactly)? Yes (if not, fix before sending – incomplete description = rejection). - Fees: ensure the member pays any required registry fee (if applicable) – the portal likely handles payment or note it. MSLR won’t process without fee.
Then submit.
1.	Follow-Up: After submission, the portal will show a status. MSLR will review. If MSLR finds an issue:
2.	If minor (like a tiny typo), they might correct and log it[45].
3.	If major or something missing, they will reject and issue a deficiency notice[75][76].
4.	That notice will come to the member (and you likely as cc). If you get a deficiency notice, help the member address it and re-submit promptly (since a transfer isn’t effective until properly registered).
If all is good, MSLR will register the transfer. The interest will now show under the Grantee’s name in the system.
1.	Confirmation & Certificate: MSLR will send out a confirmation of registration. For Métis Title, a new certificate might be issued to the new owner. Ensure the Settlement records (e.g., local land map or tax roll if any) are updated to reflect the new owner. File any paper documents accordingly.
2.	Post-Transfer: If the Grantor has now disposed of all their land and maybe is leaving the Settlement, remind them that if they ever terminate membership, land’s gone anyway (just an FYI; if they transferred all land, they might plan to resign membership – see membership termination process).
MSLR Staff Steps (for reference, you don’t do these but to know what happens):
•	They receive the submission, check completeness just like you did (they have their own internal checklist).
•	They verify no red flags: e.g., member wasn’t over acreage cap? Actually, transferring out reduces holding, so not an issue, but if Grantee would exceed cap, system would warn (Policy 10). MSLR would still process but flag to MSGC.
•	If all good, Registrar approves registration. They update registry database: interest now listed under Grantee. They generate a notice/endorsement on the instrument of registration.
•	They produce a new title certificate (if Métis Title) or update the PMT record. They log everything in audit.
•	They dispatch the confirmation/certificate to the new owner and notify the Settlement (some send to council office). They also ensure any related entries (like if a mortgage was carried over) are updated.
Checklist Reminder: Always use the Transfer checklist in Section 4 when handling these. It’s your best friend to avoid a bounce-back from MSLR.
2.2 Renewal of a Provisional Métis Title (PMT)
Scenario: A member holds a PMT that is going to expire. They want to renew it for another term. According to the law/policy, they must apply before expiry, and now with modernization, late apps are not allowed (Policy 4). We need to guide them through a timely renewal.
Key Policies: Policy 2 (notification timeline), Policy 4 (renewal rules), Policy 7 (complete application needed, no incomplete holds), Policy 4 also addresses Council’s role if they deny renewal.
Clerk’s Step-by-Step:
1.	Identify Upcoming Expiry: The digital system will flag to you PMTs in your Settlement expiring in, say, 3 months. Also, members should get a 60-day notice letter[77][78]. But proactively, you can reach out to those members as well – it’s good customer service.
Check: Did the member receive the notice? (Portal might show it sent; if physical letter returned to MSLR, they should have notified you, but since now using regular mail presumption, likely no return issues – still, you can double-check address).
1.	Assist with Renewal Application: The member must submit a renewal application before expiry date (this date is on their original certificate and the 60-day notice). Provide them the PMT Renewal form or direct them to portal. The form requires:
2.	Member’s details and PMT #.
3.	Confirmation they still meet any conditions (some PMTs had conditions like land use, though those are more council's concern).
4.	Renewal fee payment.
5.	If your Settlement requires council to approve the renewal (some might require a council motion to endorse renewing particular PMTs), then coordinate that. According to MSGC Land Policy, council is involved – either they approve or not. If council decides not to renew, that triggers a different process (they’d send MSLR a cancellation request per Policy 4).
6.	If the member had built anything or changed land use, ensure any needed development permissions are noted, but that’s not strictly an MSLR thing, just good to ensure no reason for council to deny.
7.	Timing Emphasis: Strongly emphasize: “We must get this to MSLR before [expiry date].” If they come very close to expiry, prioritize this! Even send electronically to MSLR or call to flag urgency. Because post-expiry, the system will block it[69][79]. So do not hold a renewal app. If something is missing but expiry looming, it’s tricky: by policy, incomplete won’t be accepted. Try to get it complete, but worst case, even if incomplete by a hair, submit what you have with a note; MSLR might still reject it, but at least evidence it was attempted (then it might go to appeal – messy, so better get it right beforehand).
Ideally, the member should not be last-minute – the 60-day notice plus your reminders should avoid that.
1.	Complete Submission Check: Use a Renewal application checklist:
2.	Has the member filled required fields (like current mailing address, which we need up-to-date)?
3.	Attached any required docs? Usually renewal might not need extra docs except perhaps proof of payment or council minutes if applicable.
4.	Fee included or paid? (Ensure they have a receipt if paying through Settlement or instruct them how to pay online).
5.	If any portion was incomplete, get it fixed now. (E.g., forgot to sign the form? Have them sign. Missing fee? Get it paid.)
6.	Submit to MSLR: Through the portal or via email if arranged (Portal submission is standard). Attach the council resolution if council approved the renewal. If council denied the renewal (rare at this point because if denied, why would member still submit? But if council denies, then per Policy 4, we actually should not be renewing; instead council will request cancellation after expiry. If you are aware council’s leaning to deny, inform the member that their renewal might be denied and they have right to object later – but still, process whatever official decision is made).
Submit before expiry date and note the submission date/time. The system likely records that to confirm it was timely.
1.	Deficiency or Outcome: MSLR reviews:
2.	If something’s wrong (like fee shortfall or name mismatch), they may issue deficiency. If still before expiry, correct and resubmit immediately. If deficiency comes after expiry and it can’t be resolved by expiry, that’s a problem – likely the interest will lapse. That’s why initial completeness is crucial.
3.	Assuming all good, MSLR renews the PMT. They will update expiry date in system (usually add another X years term). They’ll provide a confirmation or a new certificate of renewal.
4.	Record the Renewal: Once confirmed, update any local lists you have of land interests with the new expiry date. Notify council if they track land tenures. File away the renewal form and related docs.
5.	If Council Denied Renewal: If you had the scenario where the Settlement Council decided not to renew (maybe they felt member didn’t develop land, etc.), then:
6.	Council should issue a formal resolution denying renewal and likely not granting patent.
7.	As clerk, you or council then submit to MSLR a request to cancel the PMT upon expiry with that resolution and a copy of the member’s renewal application (Policy 4’s requirement)[16].
8.	MSLR will then, on expiry, cancel the interest rather than renew, and the member will get a 60-day cancellation notice (which they can object to – that goes to MSAT presumably).
9.	This is a complex path – ensure to loop in MSLR early if a denial is happening, so they know to expect this scenario and can handle properly (they refer objection to MSAT, etc. per Policy 3 and 4). Also, communicate to the member: they should know council denied so they aren’t thinking it’s an admin error. Possibly advise them of their right to object/appeal to MSAT.
Member FAQ you might answer during this: - “What happens if I miss the deadline?” – Unfortunately, per policy, no late renewals are accepted[69]. The interest would expire and be canceled. They could appeal to MSAT citing reasons, but that’s uncertain. Emphasize they shouldn’t miss it (and in our case, we’re doing everything to help them not miss). - “I got a notice letter 60 days prior – do I really have to act by then?” – They have 60 days after letter to object a cancellation if they weren’t renewing. But if they want to renew, they have until the expiry date itself to submit renewal. However, do not cut it close! Best to apply as soon as they gather needed docs.
MSLR Staff perspective (for your understanding): - They monitor expiring interests and likely expect renewal apps. If none comes by expiry, they auto-cancel and send cancellation notice. - When your renewal arrives, they ensure it’s before expiry. System probably won’t even allow them to process if date passed. - They check fee paid, etc. Then they update the record: new expiry date set in database. Issue either a renewal acknowledgment or updated certificate. - If any anomaly (like council letter attached saying “we don’t approve”), they likely pause and consult the Registrar – then follow the procedure (most likely proceed to cancel route). - They also send outcome letter to member and copy you.
Checklist: Use “PMT Renewal checklist” in Section 4 to verify everything before sending to MSLR.
2.3 Handling a Membership Termination and Land Interest Cancellation
Scenario: A Settlement member decides to resign (terminate) their membership, or is expelled by council, or otherwise loses membership (e.g., they registered as Status Indian and thus by MSA lost settlement membership). We need to process the membership termination and simultaneously deal with their land interests (which by law end when membership ends).
This could come either directly from a member (letter of resignation) or from Settlement Council (in case of a council-initiated termination or notice of death in some cases if no successor member).
Key Policies: Policy 5 (steps for membership terminations – no conditional holds, immediate processing), Policy 5 & MSA s.90 (land interests end on membership end), Policy 7 (again, completeness – we need all proper docs), Policy 3 (if any objection scenario arises, e.g., someone might object to an expulsion – that’s outside MSLR, but mention because if there's a legal stay, we hold off per Policy 5).
Clerk’s Step-by-Step:
1.	Receive Resignation or Notice: If a member submits a resignation letter to you (Settlement office), or if council makes a decision on membership (expulsion), you are to act promptly:
2.	Voluntary Resignation: According to MSA s.89.1, the member must give the letter to the Settlement. Mark the date you received it. The law says it’s effective 10 days after receipt unless they withdraw it[19][20].
3.	Council-initiated (expulsion): If council passes a motion to terminate membership for cause and perhaps it’s confirmed by a Special Constable or Tribunal, then you’ll have official documentation (Council resolution, possibly MSAT order if appealed).
4.	Also possible: If you learn a member registered as Status Indian (Cunningham scenario), that triggers termination by law; in practice, IR likely notifies the Settlement or MSGC. In any case, treat it similarly – you have evidence membership will end.
5.	No Conditions Allowed: Check the resignation letter for any conditions. If a member wrote, “I resign but only after I sell my house” or “please hold this until next year” – per Policy 5, this is not acceptable[17][18]. You should inform the member: “We cannot process a conditional resignation. If you’re not ready to fully leave now, then we won’t act on this until you resubmit without conditions.” Essentially, either they commit or they don’t.
6.	If they insist, you should likely follow Policy 5: return the letter to them (or at least not forward to MSLR) and say come back when ready to do it cleanly. Document that interaction (maybe a letter back citing policy).
7.	If the letter is fine (no conditions, just a straight resignation), proceed.
8.	Council Acknowledgment: Ideally, for a resignation, bring it to council (or at least inform council). Council doesn’t need to “approve” a resignation (it’s the member’s right), but council might want to pass a motion acknowledging it and instruct admin to proceed. Also, crucially, after 10 days with no retraction, the law says membership is terminated and the Settlement must send a copy to the Minister (or designate, which is MSLR)[20]. In practice, sending to MSLR suffices as they represent the Minister in registry matters.
For expulsion, council’s resolution and any MSAT confirmation should be prepared to send to MSLR.
1.	Communicate Implications to Member: If in contact with the member, politely remind them (or ensure they understand) that upon membership termination, all their land interests are terminated without further notice[7][80]. Some members don’t realize this automatic effect; best they hear it clearly now than be surprised. If they have active land dealings, maybe that’s why they tried a conditional “hold off” – but since we can’t hold off, they need to know they’ll lose the land.
2.	If a member was trying to quickly transfer land to family before resigning, advise them to do the transfer before finalizing resignation (once they’re not a member, they can’t transfer because the land is gone to settlement). But careful: you can inform but not collude in delaying beyond what MSA allows. If they want to revoke the resignation within 10 days to handle land, they can – that’s legal. (We follow MSA to the letter: they have 10 days to change mind).
3.	Submit Termination to MSLR:
4.	For a resignation: On the 11th day after receipt (if no revocation received), prepare a cover letter from Settlement Council (or Administrator) to MSLR: attaching the member’s resignation letter, stating the date received and that no revocation was received within 10 days, hence membership is terminated as of X date per MSA. Also attach any council note if they did one. Essentially fulfilling the requirement to notify MSLR (Minister)[20].
5.	For an expulsion: Send MSLR the council resolution and any supporting docs (like MSAT order if there was an appeal) indicating membership termination effective date.
6.	For other (like Status Indian registration): Provide copy of proof if available (e.g., letter from ISC confirming the person got status and thus by s.90 they ceased membership).
7.	Important: If there’s any legal stay (say the person appealed an expulsion and court issued an injunction to not remove them pending outcome), do not forward to MSLR until resolved (Policy 5 allows holding if a legal order says so). Document that in local files and inform MSLR of the situation so they don’t act prematurely.
Ensure the package to MSLR is complete: membership name, Settlement, effective date, and any land interests list (MSLR can find them, but you can highlight what interests they have to help coordinate cancellations).
1.	MSLR Processing: MSLR will, upon receiving, update Settlement Members List (remove name) and concurrently cancel all land interests of that person[81][82].
2.	They will not wait beyond effective date, they’ll do it immediately.
3.	If the person had joint interest with someone else: MSLR will remove the leaving member’s name. If it’s a joint tenancy, usually means surviving joint holder now sole owner (they might require an application or just note it – likely they treat membership loss akin to death for that interest). If interest was tenancy-in-common, the departing member’s share goes to Settlement (since no non-member can hold).
4.	MSLR will produce cancellation notices for each interest and send them out (likely to former member – though they’re no longer a member, courtesy might send a notice of land cancellation, but law doesn’t require it since s.90 is automatic. They might still notify).
5.	They’ll confirm to Settlement that interests are terminated (for our records to reallocate lands).
6.	Local Wrap-Up: Once MSLR confirms processing:
7.	Update your members registry (remove them from local member list, mark date).
8.	Update land records: those lands are now Settlement-owned (or available). Council can consider re-allotting them. You might prepare a note for council about lands freed up.
9.	If the person had any pending business (maybe an unfinished transfer or unresolved estate?), coordinate accordingly (for example, if they resigned with an estate instruction for land, that land’s gone though).
10.	Close the member’s local file. If they owed any debt or had any agreements, forward to council/administration for handling in absence of membership.
11.	Edge Case – Reversal: If within the 10 days the member revokes their resignation in writing, then do not forward to MSLR. Notify council that the resignation was retracted and membership continues. Keep records of both letter and retraction together in case of future confusion. If you already told MSLR about a pending one and then they revoked, immediately inform MSLR “do not terminate, member revoked in time.”
FAQs: - “Can a member resign effective a future date?” – They can state it but legally it takes effect in 10 days, not a specific future date beyond that. We treat letter as immediate unless revoked. They can’t say “I resign effective 6 months from now” – that’s essentially a conditional hold. So answer: No, we can’t hold it; they should submit when they’re truly ready. - “What if a member tries to resign but keep their land by transferring to a relative first?” – They must complete the transfer before the membership ends. Encourage them to do that in proper order, as once membership ends, it’s too late (land is gone to Settlement). As clerk, you can facilitate that sequence (e.g., expedite a transfer if they clearly are doing that then resigning). But ensure they either revoke resignation until transfer done, or time it within the 10-day window (though that’s risky). - “Member died, what now?” – Not exactly in this scenario, but related: if member dies, membership ends and land interests go through estate. That’s an Estate Instruction scenario (Policy 9) rather than voluntary termination. MSLR handles that via estate processes, not exactly our membership termination process (the Settlement should notify MSLR of death, then MSLR looks for estate instruction and processes – more on that in next process likely).
MSLR Staff perspective: - When they get our package, they’ll check that indeed membership is terminated by law (date calculation etc.). - They will cross-check that member’s land interests (they have them on file) – they cancel each one effective termination date. They annotate reasons (so record shows “canceled due membership termination” which is not for cause of expiry, etc.). - They ensure no further transactions occur on those interests from termination point. - They then send out notifications – perhaps to the former member’s last address (“Your membership ended, accordingly your land interests have terminated per MSA s.90” – likely a courtesy letter something like that). - If any interest had other stakeholders (like a mortgage company), they might notify them too that interest ceased. - They update Settlement Members List (which restricts access to that person’s info now since they’re ex-member – only basic record remains). - They log that no outstanding file on that person is left open (Policy 5’s point was to clear any held files – hopefully we didn’t have any held because we processed immediately). - If any scenario of fairness exception (like Vicklund case where maybe their land interest wasn’t canceled because of a court case), MSLR would handle as per that instruction (we as clerks should then also follow those special instructions – rare though).
Checklist: Use “Membership Termination & Land Cancellation checklist” for clerks: - Did member letter get stamped date? - 10 days passed? (or n/a for expulsion). - No conditions? If conditions, returned. - Council notified and docs ready? - All member’s land interests identified to follow up? - Info package to MSLR complete (including copy of letter/resolution, effective date, list of lands)? - Keep a copy of everything.
2.4 Accessing the Settlement Members List (Privacy Compliance)
Scenario: As a Settlement Clerk or MSLR staff, you often get requests like “Can I get a copy of the members list?” or “Is Person X a member of this Settlement?” or “We need the list for election or program.” You need to handle these requests under the new strict access rules (Policy 6 and privacy laws).
While not a “transaction”, it’s a common process to address.
Key Policies: Policy 6 (who can access the Members List and conditions), FOIP Act principles, Policy 16 (system logs access).
Clerk’s Step-by-Step:
1.	Identify the Requester and Purpose: When someone asks for membership info, first categorize them:
2.	Are they Settlement Council/staff? (If yes, authorized for list of their Settlement if needed for official purpose).
3.	MSGC or IR government official? (Yes if official purpose, e.g., MSGC election or govt verifying member for scholarship).
4.	Individual member asking about themselves? (They can get their own info, absolutely).
5.	Other individual asking about someone else (like a bank verifying membership for a loan)? (Not automatically authorized – need consent or authority).
6.	Lawyer or representative claiming to have permission? (Check written consent from the member or legal power).
7.	If the request doesn’t clearly fit allowed categories, likely you must deny or refer to FOIP process.
8.	Verify Authorization: Don’t just take their word. If a council member asks, you know them – fine. If an outside government person asks (like someone from a provincial program), ensure they have identification and a valid reason (e.g., “We need to verify if John Doe is a member for a grant eligibility.” – probably allowed as it’s regulatory need). If a lawyer requests info, ask for a letter of authorization from the member or a court order. If a researcher or random person asks for the list, that’s a no – not authorized (unless they go through FOIP and even then likely not given).
9.	Scope & Minimum Necessary: Even if authorized, provide only what’s needed. E.g., if council asks “Is X a member of our Settlement?” you can simply confirm yes or no, rather than giving them a whole list or personal details of X beyond confirmation (though as council, they could see the list if needed). If MSGC needs a full list for an MSGC election – they are authorized to get it, but ensure it’s used for that purpose. For someone verifying one name, don’t hand them the whole list, just answer their query.
10.	Method of Access: Use the digital portal if possible:
11.	If the person has access (like council can log in to see their membership list), encourage them to use that so the access is logged.
12.	If not, you (clerk) can look up the information and provide a printout or verbal confirmation as appropriate, but remember to log that you did so (perhaps a note to MSLR or in your files “On Jan 5, confirmed membership status of John Doe to XYZ for purpose ABC” – good practice under privacy to track disclosures).
13.	Privacy Safeguards: Do not leave printed lists lying around. If you print something (say the current Members List for an upcoming election), mark it confidential and give it only to the person authorized (e.g., Returning Officer). After use, ensure it’s destroyed securely (shredded) or returned. If emailing any membership info, ensure it’s to an official email and encrypted if possible (since email can be insecure). Always double-check the identity of the requester especially if not in person (if someone calls claiming to be a gov’t official, you might call back through official number to verify identity).
14.	Auditing: If using the portal or system, know that what you access is logged. As clerk, only access what you need. E.g., avoid browsing the list out of curiosity – it’s monitored (Policy 16 logs)[65][22]. This protects you as well – if something is questioned, you can justify all your accesses as business-need. If MSLR audits and asks why you accessed certain records, you should have an answer (e.g., “Council asked me to verify those five new applicants' prior membership status.” – legitimate).
15.	Denying Unauthorised Requests: If someone not authorized asks, politely refuse:
16.	“I’m sorry, that information is confidential. I cannot release the members list/personal information to you. If you need it, you might consider making a formal request under FOIP to the Ministry.” (They likely won’t bother if it’s not important, but that’s the channel).
17.	Do not be pressured – e.g., sometimes extended family might ask “Is my cousin a member? I need to know for estate reasons.” Unless they have legal authority, you can’t tell them. Guide them that the person themselves or executor should contact us.
18.	Member Self-Request: If a member wants to see their own membership record to ensure it’s correct (address, date of entry, etc.), absolutely show them or provide them their details (after verifying their identity if you don’t personally know them). They have that right, and it’s good to keep records current.
19.	Periodic List Use: Settlement offices often use the list for things like creating a voters list for Settlement Council elections or distribution of notices to members. That’s within council’s authority. Just ensure after that purpose, the data is kept secure or disposed properly.
MSLR Staff notes: - They will monitor unusual access patterns. If something triggers (like a clerk downloading the entire membership list of all settlements – which you shouldn’t do because you only have access to yours by design, but hypothetically), they might follow up. - If they receive FOIP requests from external, they might coordinate with you or handle it centrally. - They update the Members List (when new members added or removed) via official channels – for new members, they rely on Settlement sending membership orders or MSGC notifications. - MSLR will log every user account that views the list (for example, if you print a list from portal, it logs that event). - If any breach occurred (info leaked), MSLR and IR would handle investigation, and logs would be used.
Checklist for Clerks on Member Info request: - Identify requester (Council/staff, MSGC/gov, self, other). - Confirm purpose legitimate. - If required, get consent or authority documentation. - Provide only needed info. - Remind recipient to keep it confidential/use properly. - Log the disclosure in your notes (optional but recommended). - Do not provide if not allowed; refer them properly.
2.5 Processing an Estate Instruction / Land Transfer on Death
Scenario: A member has passed away. They had filed Estate Instructions with MSLR specifying who should get their land, or if not, land reverts to settlement. As a clerk, you might get inquiries from the family or need to coordinate with MSLR on transferring the land interest to the heir.
Key Policies: Policy 9 (Estate Instructions), plus underlying MSA rules on estates (Member’s land goes per instructions or if none to Settlement), also Policy 5 (membership termination by death triggers land interest termination – but estate instructions provide the successor within allowed parameters).
Clerk’s Step-by-Step:
1.	Notify MSLR of Death: Once a member’s death is confirmed (e.g., you received a death certificate or know from community), the Settlement should inform MSLR promptly in writing. Include member’s full name, membership #, date of death, and any info on known estate instructions or next of kin if you have it. (Sometimes families inform MSLR directly too, but ensure it’s done).
2.	This triggers MSLR to look up any estate instruction on file.
3.	Check for Estate Instructions Copy: You might not have the content (instructions are confidential in MSLR vault until death). But if the member told you or you were witness to them filing something, you might be aware. If family asks “Did they leave land to someone?” – best answer: “They may have filed estate instructions with MSLR; we have to wait for MSLR to confirm the outcome.”
4.	Hold Land Transactions: If any land interest of the deceased was in process (like they were in middle of transferring to someone or had a pending renewal), those are now paused. No transactions happen until estate settled. Inform any potential transferees or involved parties that now it goes to estate.
5.	Coordinate with Executor/Heirs: Often the family or executor will approach either Settlement or MSLR. If they come to you:
6.	Explain generally: Land interests on Settlement can only go to Settlement members (or be sold with proceeds to estate if going to non-member, etc.). If the deceased left an instruction naming an eligible heir (who is a member or will become one), MSLR will facilitate transfer to that person. If no instruction, the land returns to Settlement (and there might be compensation to estate for improvements depending on local practice, but legally it just reverts).
7.	Gather contact info for the heir or executor. You might need to pass documents for signature.
8.	If the named heir is not a member but perhaps eligible (like a child who could apply for membership), inform them that they must become a member to inherit, otherwise the land can’t be given to them (the policy doesn’t allow transfer to non-member).
9.	If multiple people think they have claim (siblings etc.), advise them to await MSLR’s determination (most recent valid instruction prevails).
10.	From MSLR's side: They will identify the most recent estate instruction:
11.	If one exists: It names a beneficiary (one person). MSLR will prepare to transfer interest to that person, pending verification that person is a member or will be.
12.	If more than one instruction (like found an older one and a newer one), they only honor the latest as per Policy 9 (others are superseded).
13.	If none on file: land interest will be canceled and revert to Settlement in registry.
14.	Implementation of Transfer: MSLR will likely send you or the executor a set of documents to effect the transfer:
15.	Possibly a form or letter for the executor to sign off confirming the rightful heir (especially if there’s no dispute).
16.	If the beneficiary is a member: they will get title/PMT in their name. Council might still have to approve a new Metis Title issue if needed – unclear, but likely not; it’s by operation of estate.
17.	If beneficiary is not a member: Typically, that interest cannot be registered to them. Usually the Land Policy might require settlement to pay them value or something. But legally, the interest terminates. They might appeal to MSAT if fairness dictates something (like sometimes MSAT allow short grace to sell interest or so). This is complex; if it happens, coordinate with MSGC legal or MSAT for a solution. As clerk, you may inform them to talk to a lawyer since they cannot hold land as non-member.
18.	If any doubt or conflict (multiple instructions, contested will, etc.), MSLR may refer to MSAT or court. In such a case, it's on hold (they won’t finalize until that’s sorted). If you catch wind of a family dispute, inform MSLR so they don’t prematurely transfer – likely they wait a bit for any will challenge.
19.	Finalize in Registry: Once MSLR is satisfied:
20.	They will update the interest record: new owner (beneficiary) or cancel if none.
21.	They will treat the date of death effectively like membership termination date for registry, but with immediate re-registration to heir if applicable (so interest might not be canceled if directly transferring – effectively akin to transmission process).
22.	They’ll maintain confidentiality of instructions: they won’t publish the instruction content; just effect the result.
23.	Local Effects:
24.	Update membership list (the deceased is removed).
25.	Update land records to new owner if there is one. Or note the land as back to Settlement if no heir.
26.	If land reverted to Settlement, inform council they can reallot. Usually they'd wait some respectful time or legal clearance (to ensure no late claims).
27.	If new owner gained the interest, welcome them (if they were not previously a member of your settlement, they must be or become one to hold it, so presumably now a member – update records accordingly if they transferred membership from another settlement perhaps).
28.	Member’s Family FAQ:
29.	“What about his house/land?” – If estate instruction says to his son (a member), your son will get it; MSLR will do paperwork. If no instruction, unfortunately the land returns to the community, not into the estate. We can’t just give it to someone without instruction and membership because of law.
30.	“Can we see the estate instruction?” – Those were confidential. Typically only the executor or the beneficiary would see it after death. MSLR might provide a copy to the beneficiary as part of transfer process. As clerk, you likely won’t release it yourself (you might not even have it). Direct that request to MSLR or the legal process.
MSLR Staff perspective: - They check instruction authenticity (properly executed, most recent). - If multiple potential beneficiaries (like instruction per interest), they handle each interest accordingly. They ensure no splitting of interest beyond what's allowed (Policy 9 no partial splits – interest must go whole to one person)[83]. If an instruction tried to split, MSLR likely invalidates that part – and perhaps the interest would revert or they might need court direction. - They maintain secure vault for these docs and release minimal info necessary. - They coordinate with MSAT if any question arises about validity (the Land Policy might direct disputes to MSAT). - They notify the Settlement after completion who got the land, so records align.
Checklist (for estate land transfer): - Death certificate obtained (yes). - MSLR notified (date, by letter or system input). - Confirm if decedent had any known preferences (did they mention an heir to someone? Regardless, rely on official instruction but any clue helps prepare). - If beneficiary contacts, confirm their membership status. - Ensure any property on land (house etc.) is secured until ownership resolved (this might be more of council matter, but just note to prevent unauthorized use). - After MSLR action, update local records and inform relevant parties (like the new owner to come sign any local agreements like housing agreements maybe).

Section 3: FAQs and Troubleshooting
This section addresses frequently asked questions from both staff and Settlement members, providing quick answers or actions:
Q1: A member says they never got their 60-day expiry notice and now the 60 days passed – what do I do?
A1: First, check the registry system – did MSLR send it to the address on file? (They likely did via regular mail and portal). Under policy, not receiving it doesn’t stop cancellation if timeframe passed, since it’s deemed received in 7 days[11]. If their interest got canceled, their option is to file an objection immediately (within the allowed 60 days from send – they might be just at tail end). Help them draft an objection citing maybe “didn’t actually receive notice due to address issue, request reinstatement.” Submit to MSLR quickly. Advise them to update address! For future, ensure address was current (Policy 2 emphasizes members must maintain address[84]). This is more reactive – prevention is better by keeping addresses updated.
Q2: I submitted a transfer to MSLR a week ago and haven’t heard. The parties are anxious. How can I check status?
A2: Log into the portal, look at that transaction’s status. It might say “Pending” or “Completed” or “Deficiency Issued.” If pending beyond expected time (say usually they turn around in a few days), call or message the MSLR contact. Possibly something’s held it up. Maybe a backlog or a question. Also check your messages – did MSLR ask for clarification? If deficiency, it should show. If just slow, reassure parties and continue to follow up. Typically modernization aims for quick turnaround, so delays might mean an issue flagged (like maybe they found an acreage cap issue or a missing doc that we somehow missed). Proactively contact MSLR to resolve.
Q3: A non-member (e.g., bank or an appraiser) asks for confirmation of a particular land interest details (like who owns it, or to see a plan). Can I share that?
A3: Ownership of Settlement lands is not public like Land Titles. Only authorized can access. A bank typically will have the member’s consent (if member is getting a loan and pledging the interest, they should provide a letter authorizing disclosure to the bank). If you have that, you can confirm ownership and any encumbrances to the bank. Without consent, we generally shouldn’t disclose details to a third party. Suggest to the bank to have the member authorize it or have the member request the info and give it to bank. Survey plans or general land descriptions might be shared if needed (a plan doesn’t show personal info, just land – sharing a plan for legitimate purpose is likely fine). Always err on caution and possibly get MSLR guidance if unsure.
Q4: The portal won’t let me submit an application because it says something like “Member exceeds land holding limit” or “subdivision approval required.” What do I do?
A4: The system is enforcing Policy 1 or 10. - If it’s acreage limit warning (Policy 10): It might still allow submission with a warning (since for PMT we flag but don’t outright reject)[85][86]. You should inform the member that they’re over the allowed land cap. They can proceed, but MSLR will notify and it could lead to future policy action (not losing land immediately but flagged). If it’s a Metis Title registration over cap, system likely blocks it (because MSLR will reject)[87]. In that case, they cannot proceed unless perhaps some land is transferred out or they get a policy exemption from MSGC (rare). So likely, they can’t do what they want because rule is rule. Advise them accordingly. - If it’s subdivision needed: That means they tried to transfer part of an interest (system detects partial legal description or a fraction share). They must go back and get a survey plan and council subdivision approval first (Policy 1). So stop that process, and initiate the subdivision procedure with them.
Q5: A member’s PMT expired and they didn’t renew in time, now they want it back.
A5: Per Policy 4, if expired unrenewed, MSLR canceled it[88]. The land is now effectively available for re-allotment. The member can file an objection (within 60 days of cancellation notice) on grounds like they had reasons, but if they simply forgot, MSAT might not favor that (they could try pleading fairness). As clerk, you can support them by writing a letter explaining any extenuating circumstances if true (e.g., they were hospitalized and missed all notices). But once canceled, only MSAT (appeal) can restore or order reconsideration, since MSLR’s policy doesn’t allow late renewal. Suggest they file appeal promptly. Also, notify council so they hold off reallocating that land until appeal time passes or is decided, out of fairness.
Q6: We have some very old “Allocation” files where people never did anything. What should I do with those?
A6: Policy 12 says allocations should have fixed terms and expire if not converted[89][90]. For old ones lingering, coordinate with MSLR: - Identify those cases, check if any term was given (maybe not). - Likely MSLR and MSGC will decide to formally terminate them by setting an expiry. You may need to send notices to those holders saying “Your allocation will expire on X date unless you act (apply for PMT or renewal).” - This might be part of a cleanup project. Ask MSLR if they plan a blanket cancellation for stale allocations and how to handle communications. Until then, avoid treating them like permanent interests (don’t allow transfers of them). - If holder comes in now wanting to convert to PMT, great – help them apply before we cancel (Policy 12 encourages conversion before expiry). - So, proactively, maybe reach out to those holders: “You’ve had an allocation since 2005 and never converted; do you wish to? Otherwise policy says it will be canceled.” That spurs action or frees land for others.
Q7: MSLR rejected a document because it had an alteration that wasn’t initialed by both parties. What to do?
A7: If one party only initialed a change, you need to get the other party to also initial to confirm they agree, or redo the page. For example, they changed the purchase price on transfer and only buyer initialed. Have the seller also initial next to that change. Then resubmit. (Better: always have both signatories initial any change when signing.) If the document’s integrity is questionable (many changes), safest to execute a fresh, clean document. Explain to parties it’s needed to avoid any doubt. Not fun to resign, but necessary for valid registration.
Q8: I accidentally gave some membership info to someone I maybe shouldn’t have (like confirmed something to a curious relative). What should I do?
A8: Mistakes happen. Immediately inform your supervisor or MSLR privacy contact about what was disclosed and to whom. It may be a minor breach or none (if it was public knowledge or trivial). But transparent reporting is best in case it escalates. They might advise you to notify the member whose info was shared, depending on severity (if it was sensitive personal data, likely yes). Learn from it – refresh on Policy 6. It’s usually not catastrophic if it was, say, confirming someone is a member (some communities that’s not secret). But other details (addresses, etc.) should be protected. So, take it as a training moment, and ensure proper steps are taken to contain any issue.
Q9: There’s talk in the community about someone possibly appealing to MSAT regarding an MSLR decision. What is my role?
A9: If you hear of an appeal (e.g., someone objected to a cancellation and now it’s going to MSAT), your role is mainly to provide any info MSAT might request (like background, dates, or council input). MSLR will present their records. You as clerk could be asked to clarify any council actions or communications with the person. Be honest and factual. It’s not adversarial with you; MSAT just needs the facts. Ensure any relevant documents from Settlement side (like council resolution, correspondence) are forwarded to MSLR or MSAT as appropriate. After MSAT decision, implement whatever outcome: if MSAT says restore interest, work with MSLR to do so; if upholds cancellation, then it’s final – you can inform council they can reallocate land now or such.
Q10: The new portal is down (hypothetical). How do we continue work?
A10: There should be contingency. If portal downtime is announced or evident, revert to offline process temporarily: - Accept paper submissions from members as needed, timestamp them. - Communicate with MSLR via phone/email to say “I have X submission here, portal down – will input once up, but consider it received now.” This protects timelines (like if someone came on day 59 to object and portal was down, at least email MSLR the objection so it’s recorded). - IT likely fixes portal quick if it’s an issue. Resume as soon as up, and input any backlog that accumulated. - Portal downtime should be rare (with redundant systems). But always have forms on hand and MSLR contacts ready.

- [ ] Signatures and dates everywhere needed.
- [ ] Form version is current (use latest forms, not outdated ones).
- [ ] No scribbles/illegible text – if so, rewrite neatly or type.
- [ ] Member’s contact info (especially phone/email) included, in case MSLR needs to contact them quickly.
- [ ] Test of completeness: Ask “Could MSLR register this without any additional info?” If yes, good. If you yourself would have a question looking at it, then MSLR will too – resolve it now.
If all above are ticked, likelihood of rejection is extremely low. This ensures quicker turnaround and happy members!

Section 5: Reference
5.1 Policy Quick Reference Table:
Policy #	Title (Short)	What it means in practice (one-liner)
1	Partial Interests & Subdivision	Can’t transfer part of land without prior council-approved subdivision. (No premature splitting)
2	60-Day Expiry Notices	MSLR sends expiry notice 60 days before PMT ends (regular mail + digital); no response -> cancel after 60 days.
3	Objections to Cancellations	Members have 60 days after cancellation notice to object; MSLR pauses cancel and reviews/forwards to MSAT as needed.
4	PMT Renewal & Cancellation	Renew before expiry only; late = no go. If council denies renewal, they must inform MSLR to cancel at expiry (with proof member applied on time).
5	Membership & Land Termination	When membership ends, all land interests end immediately. No “hold my resignation” – either in or out. Clear backlog by returning incomplete terminations.
6	Access to Members List	Strictly limited to authorized persons (councils, MSGC, etc.) and purpose; maintain privacy and log all access.
7	Incomplete Requests = Rejected	If an application to MSLR is missing something, MSLR will not process it – will send it back for fixes immediately. No pending trays.
8	Digital Maps & Plans	Encourage digital survey plans for accuracy; smaller utility projects can use sketches; integrate with ARLO mapping.
9	Estate Instructions (Land Wills)	Only one heir per interest; most recent instruction counts; confidential until death; upon death, transfer interest per instruction to member heir (if none or heir non-member, interest reverts).
10	Land Holding Limits	Flags if member would exceed acreage cap (policy enforced for new titles, flagged for PMTs); MSLR cannot fully enforce beyond its legal power – but reports it.
11	Unsurveyed Land Interests	Allow registering interests with descriptions (GPS, etc.) on unsurveyed lands, but require eventual survey before certain actions; unsurveyed = provisional.
12	Allocation Interests	Must have end dates; convert to permanent interest or expire; can’t be transferred to others; monitor and cancel stale allocations.
13	Survey Plan Requirements	Need survey plans for major interests (new titles, ROWs), but not for minor utility service lines (sketch ok); effective Apr 1, 2009 rule continued.
14	Document Alterations & Corrections	Minor typos can be fixed by staff with note; major changes need new doc; all alterations must be initialed; keep correction logs.
15	MSLR Counter Service (Role)	MSLR staff = registry only, not advisors: they won’t fill forms or give legal advice. They give info and refer to Settlement for help. Members should complete forms themselves (with clerk help for understanding).
16	Digital Portal Access & Security	All portal users require verified accounts and 2FA; strict role permissions; system logs everything; regular security audits – protects our data.
Use this table to quickly recall a policy’s essence. For full details, consult the main Policy Book.
5.2 Important Contacts:
•	MSLR Registrar Office: Phone XXX-XXX-XXXX, Email mslr.registrar@gov.ab.ca
For escalation of unusual cases, legal clarifications, etc.
•	MSLR Technical Helpdesk: (for portal issues) Phone XXX-XXX-YYYY, Email mslr.support@gov.ab.ca
Use for any system glitches or login troubles.
•	Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal (MSAT) Registry: Phone XXX-XXX-ZZZZ
If you need to forward an appeal or get info on an ongoing appeal.
•	Indigenous Relations FOIP Coordinator: Phone or Email …
In case of any privacy breach or FOIP requests, coordinate through this person.
•	Metis Settlements General Council – Land & Membership Committee contact: [Name, contact]
If any MSGC-level questions or to clarify Land Policy interpretations beyond our policy book.
Each Settlement office should also list their internal contacts (e.g., Council Chair, Settlement Administrator) here for staff reference when needing approvals or local decisions quickly.
5.3 Glossary:
•	PMT: Provisional Metis Title – a time-limited land interest (usually 21-year renewable term).
•	Metis Title (Patent): A long-term (sort of perpetual) land interest akin to fee simple on Settlement land, issued by Minister but governed by MSA constraints (only members can hold).
•	Allotment/Allocation: Initial land grant pending meeting conditions or waiting conversion – temporary and not fully secured until converted to PMT or Metis Title.
•	MSLR07 Form: An internal form (commonly used for council to request actions like cancellation or to transmit decisions to MSLR).
•	MSAT: Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal – hears appeals on membership and land disputes.
•	Deficiency Notice: A notice from MSLR saying an application is incomplete or incorrect, thus not accepted unless fixed.
•	Objection (60-day): Formal written statement by a member opposing the cancellation of their interest, submitted to MSLR within 60 days of notice, triggering a review/appeal.
•	Role-based Access: System design where users only see what they should (e.g., clerks see their Settlement data, not others).
•	MFA/2FA: Multi-factor authentication – a security step requiring a code or second verification beyond password.
5.4 Final Tips:
•	When in doubt, communicate. Ask the Registrar’s office when unusual things pop up – better to check than guess.
•	Always keep members informed of what’s happening with their application. A well-informed member is a happy member, even if the answer isn’t what they hoped.
•	Protect data integrity and privacy as top priorities – double-check entries, lock your screen when away, and follow policy for sharing info.
•	Embrace the digital tools – they are there to ease our work (automatic checks, logs). Use them fully rather than bypassing; it will save time and reduce errors.
•	We, as Settlement staff and MSLR staff, are a team. We each have our lanes, but together we ensure the land registry serves the community efficiently and lawfully.
By using this guidebook and adhering to the policies, you’ll help maintain a Land Registry that is trusted, up-to-date, and supportive of Metis Settlement governance and prosperity.
Thank you for your diligence and service!

Rationale and context
Risk‑management context
The ministry’s risk register identifies the Modernised Service and Land Records (MSLR) programme as high‑risk because fragmented data collections, decentralized storage and outdated processes increase the likelihood of data loss and non‑compliance with statutory record‑keeping obligations. Independent authorities note that electronic records are hardware‐ and software‑dependent; if the storage medium becomes obsolete or the software used to create the data is no longer available, the information may become unreadable[1]. Decentralized storage on personal computers and web applications increases the risk of data loss and reduces the likelihood that staff will migrate records to newer formats[2]. The North Dakota electronic records management guidelines warn that without clear procedures employees may not understand the value of their records or their legal obligations, creating a risk of significant losses in terms of history and accountability[3]. Consequently, agencies must ensure government records in any format are managed in compliance with records laws and requirements[4].
Statutory requirements mandate the preservation of essential records—information needed to conduct the organisation’s essential functions and to protect the legal and financial rights of individuals[5]. Records management systems must therefore maintain the authenticity, integrity and reliability of records and prevent unauthorized alteration or deletion[6]. A well‑defined records management programme improves regulatory compliance and avoids severe legal or fiscal consequences[7]. Policies should outline what data needs to be retained, how long it should be kept, who may dispose of it and what to do in the event of a policy violation[8]. In practice, comprehensive records management helps retain business‑critical records, standardise formats, enhance operational efficiency and ensure compliance[9].
Data‑protection justification
The risk register also highlights the threat of irretrievable data loss from cyber‑attacks, hardware failure or human error. Information‑security guidance recommends following the 3‑2‑1 backup rule—maintain three copies of data on at least two different media, with one copy stored off‑site—to reduce the risk of losing vital information[10]. Implementing regular backups, monitoring and testing them, and automating backup processes reduces human error and ensures that data can be restored[11]. The proposed policy therefore integrates modern backup and disaster‑recovery practices alongside records‑management requirements.
Need for a modernised policy book
During the ministry’s modernisation efforts a core policy book was drafted. Since that time additional material (“MSLR Extra”) and policies outside the approved folder have surfaced. Some were implemented informally and others remain aspirational. The risk register’s high‑risk assessment underscores that failing to update the policy book could lead to data loss and non‑compliance, jeopardising legal obligations and public trust. The finalised modernised policy book presented below integrates the original policies, the new material and best practices from authoritative sources to provide a coherent, enforceable framework.
Finalised Modernised Policy Book
1. Purpose
The Modernised Service and Land Records (MSLR) Policy Book establishes mandatory principles and procedures for creating, receiving, retaining, securing, accessing and disposing of the ministry’s records. It ensures compliance with statutory requirements, reduces the risk of data loss, protects sensitive information, and supports transparent and accountable service delivery.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors and volunteers involved in the creation, use or management of MSLR data across physical and digital formats. It covers policies previously approved, new provisions contained in the MSLR Extra document and other policies found outside the approved folder that have been deemed relevant after assessment. External partners and vendors must adhere to the relevant provisions when handling ministry data.
3. Definitions
•	Record – Information, regardless of medium or format, that documents the organisation, functions, policies, decisions or activities of the ministry. Records include both physical documents and digital files.
•	Essential Records – Records needed to conduct essential functions or protect the legal and financial rights of individuals. They must remain accessible and protected[5].
•	Recordkeeping System – An electronic or manual system used to capture, organise, maintain and dispose of records while ensuring authenticity and integrity[6].
•	Retention Schedule – A document specifying how long each record type must be kept and its disposition (retain, archive or destroy)[8].
•	3‑2‑1 Backup Rule – A data‑protection method requiring three copies of data stored on two different media, with at least one copy held off‑site[10].
4. Policy Statements
4.1 Record Creation and Classification
1.	Employees must create accurate and complete records for all official activities. Emails, documents, maps, surveys, land registry entries and digital images that record decisions or transactions are considered records and must be captured.
2.	Records shall be classified according to function (e.g., land registration, surveying, correspondence), sensitivity (public, restricted, confidential) and retention requirements. The classification determines security controls and retention periods.
3.	Drafts and working copies are not considered records unless they document a significant decision or legal commitment. Non‑record materials (e.g., convenience copies, personal notes) should be deleted or disposed of promptly[12].
4.2 Retention and Disposition
1.	The ministry shall maintain a master retention schedule that specifies required retention periods and final disposition for each record series. Retention periods must satisfy legislative requirements and business needs[8].
2.	Records shall not be destroyed or deleted unless authorised by the retention schedule and approved by the Records Officer. Unauthorised destruction or alteration of records is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.
3.	Records scheduled for permanent retention shall be transferred to the ministry archives or an approved long‑term digital repository with appropriate metadata.
4.	Obsolete records beyond the retention period shall be securely destroyed using methods appropriate to the medium (e.g., shredding paper, secure digital erasure).
4.3 Electronic Recordkeeping and Digital Preservation
1.	All digital records must be managed within an electronic recordkeeping system that captures metadata, preserves content, context and structure, and prevents unauthorised alteration[6].
2.	Staff must not rely on personal hard drives, removable media or unsanctioned cloud services to store official records. The ND guidelines highlight that reliance on personal computers increases the risk of data loss and reduces migration to new formats[2].
3.	Digital records should be stored in non‑proprietary or widely adopted formats where possible to facilitate long‑term accessibility. Regular migration plans should be implemented to prevent obsolescence.
4.	Data quality checks should be performed to ensure scans and digital copies are complete, legible and free from corruption.
4.4 Backup and Disaster Recovery
1.	The ministry shall implement a 3‑2‑1 backup strategy: maintain at least three copies of critical data on two different media types, with one copy stored off‑site[10]. This includes on‑site storage (e.g., network‑attached storage), off‑site physical backups and encrypted cloud backups.
2.	Backup schedules must be defined (e.g., daily incremental backups, weekly full backups) and documented. Backups should be monitored and tested regularly to ensure recoverability[11].
3.	Disaster recovery procedures shall outline steps for restoring services after data loss events. Recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) must be established based on business needs.
4.	Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. Access to backups must be restricted and logged.
4.5 Physical and Environmental Controls
1.	Physical records must be stored in secure facilities with controlled access, adequate fire protection, environmental controls (temperature/humidity) and pest management.
2.	Movement of physical records outside secured facilities requires written authorisation and must be recorded.
3.	Disaster preparedness plans must include measures to protect records from fire, flood and other hazards.
4.6 Security and Confidentiality
1.	Employees shall protect confidential and personally identifiable information from unauthorised access. Security controls must align with applicable privacy legislation.
2.	Access to records must be based on the principle of least privilege. User access rights shall be reviewed periodically.
3.	Data breaches or suspected unauthorized disclosures must be reported immediately to the Records Officer and Information Security Officer.
4.7 Training and Awareness
1.	All staff must complete records management training upon hiring and periodically thereafter. Training shall cover record identification, classification, retention schedules, security requirements and backup procedures.
2.	The ministry shall provide guidance materials (see the Guidebook below) and maintain an online knowledge base.
3.	Managers must ensure that contractors and third‑party service providers are aware of and adhere to these policies.
4.8 Compliance and Auditing
1.	The Records Officer shall conduct periodic audits of recordkeeping practices to verify compliance with this policy. Findings and recommendations must be reported to senior management.
2.	Non‑compliance may result in disciplinary measures and, where applicable, legal penalties.
3.	The policy shall be reviewed at least every three years or sooner if legislation or business needs change.

Budget Proposal
The proposed budget is high‑level and should be refined through procurement processes. Costs are expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD) and assume the ministry already has basic IT infrastructure.
Cost category	Description	Estimated cost range (CAD)	Notes
Project management and staff time	Dedicated Records Officer (0.5 FTE), IT support, project manager over 18 months	$150 000–$220 000	Utilise existing staff where possible; secondment from other departments can lower cost.
Electronic Recordkeeping System (ERKS)	Licensing or development of a compliant ERKS, including metadata, classification and retention functionality	$80 000–$200 000	Open‑source options may reduce fees; government‑hosted solutions could be leveraged.
Hardware and storage	Network‑attached storage units, external backup media, off‑site storage services, scanning equipment	$60 000–$100 000	Reuse existing hardware where possible; negotiate with central IT for shared services.
Cloud backup subscription	Encrypted cloud storage to satisfy the off‑site backup requirement	$20 000–$40 000 (annual)	Costs vary depending on data volume; consider government cloud agreements.
Digitisation services	Outsourcing or in‑house scanning of legacy paper records; includes labour and equipment	$100 000–$250 000	Prioritise essential records to control costs; use phased approach.
Training and change management	Developing training materials, conducting workshops and creating the guidebook	$30 000–$50 000	Use internal expertise and online modules to reduce expenses.
Audit and compliance	External audit support and legal consultation to ensure compliance	$20 000–$40 000	May be lower if internal audit resources are available.
Contingency (10–15 %)	Reserve for unforeseen costs	$40 000–$90 000	Recommended to mitigate risks.
Total estimated budget: $500 000–$950 000 over approximately two fiscal years. This range can be adjusted downward by leveraging shared services, delaying less critical digitisation or adopting open‑source solutions.
Guidebook for Staff and Managers
The guidebook supplements the policy by providing practical instructions and checklists. It should be distributed as a separate document or integrated into the ministry’s intranet.
1. Introduction
The guidebook explains the importance of records management and provides step‑by‑step instructions to comply with the Modernised MSLR Policy Book. It is designed for all staff and is organised by common tasks.
2. Identifying a Record
1.	Ask “Does this document a decision or transaction?” If yes, it is likely a record.
2.	Check the retention schedule to determine the record series and retention period.
3.	Determine sensitivity (public, restricted, confidential) to apply appropriate security controls.
4.	Capture metadata (creator, date, description, keywords) when storing digital files.
3. Creating and Capturing Records
•	Use official templates for letters, memos, reports and registry entries.
•	Save electronic records directly into the ERKS or approved shared drives, not on personal drives. Ensure metadata fields are completed.
•	Label physical records clearly with unique identifiers. File them in the designated location within three days of creation.
•	For emails that constitute records, save them to the ERKS or use the email integration feature to capture them automatically.
4. Classifying and Filing Records
•	Use the approved classification scheme. If unsure, consult the Records Officer.
•	File documents promptly to ensure they are discoverable and protected.
•	Group related documents into folders or electronic containers representing transactions or projects.
5. Applying Retention and Disposal
•	Refer to the retention schedule regularly. The ERKS will flag records approaching their retention period.
•	For physical records, the Records Officer will issue destruction notices. Do not dispose of any records without written authorisation.
•	For digital records, the ERKS will automate disposal after approval. Confirm before final deletion.
6. Backing Up Your Work
•	Ensure that all critical files are stored in locations included in the ministry’s backup plan. Personal devices and external drives are not backed up.
•	Do not alter or disable backup settings. Report backup failures or anomalies to IT immediately.
7. Protecting Confidential Information
•	Follow the classification guidelines: restrict access to confidential records to authorised individuals only.
•	Use strong passwords and do not share credentials.
•	Do not email confidential information to personal accounts or unencrypted recipients.
•	If a breach or exposure occurs, report it immediately to the Records Officer and Information Security Officer.
8. Handling Paper Records
•	Store paper records in secured cabinets or rooms when not in use.
•	Control access using keys or access cards. Do not leave sensitive documents unattended.
•	Protect records from environmental damage by maintaining appropriate humidity and temperature. Use archival‑quality folders and boxes for long‑term storage.
•	When scanning records, follow the scanning standard (minimum 300 dpi, colour where necessary). Verify legibility before disposing of originals.
9. Requesting Records (Access and FOIP)
•	Direct all external requests for records to the designated FOIP officer.
•	Do not release records without proper authorisation and redaction of sensitive information.
•	Maintain a log of requests and disclosures for auditing purposes.
10. Training and Support
•	New employees must complete the records management training module within one month of hire.
•	Refresher training is required every two years or when significant policy changes occur.
•	The intranet hosts guides, FAQs and video tutorials. Contact the Records Officer for assistance.
Conclusion
The ministry’s risk register highlights the critical need for a comprehensive, modern records management policy that integrates data protection and backup practices. The finalised Modernised MSLR Policy Book above, together with the implementation plan, budget proposal and practical guidebook, provides the structure required to reduce the risk of data loss, comply with statutory obligations and support efficient service delivery. By implementing these measures—particularly adopting an electronic recordkeeping system, following a 3‑2‑1 backup strategy[10], and training staff—the ministry can ensure that essential records remain accessible, authentic and secure for the benefit of current and future stakeholders.

1.	Configure ERKS – Set up classification schemes, metadata fields, access controls and retention rules. Integrate with existing business applications (e.g., land registry, survey processing).
2.	Deploy Backup Infrastructure – Implement the 3‑2‑1 backup strategy. Procure or reconfigure network storage, external media and cloud services. Document backup schedules and test restore procedures[11].
3.	Digitise Physical Records – Prioritise essential and high‑risk records for scanning. Develop scanning standards (resolution, format, metadata). Outsource high‑volume scanning if cost‑effective.
4.	Migrate Legacy Digital Records – Transfer existing digital files into the ERKS, ensuring metadata is captured and file formats are preserved or converted.
5.	Pilot and Acceptance Testing – Conduct pilot implementations with selected units. Test record capture, retrieval, retention enforcement and backup recovery.
Phase 4 – Training and Organisation‑Wide Rollout (Month 12–18)
1.	Develop Training Materials and Guidebook – Create user manuals, FAQs, quick reference cards and e‑learning modules.
2.	Conduct Training Sessions – Provide role‑based training for employees, managers and system administrators. Emphasise the importance of compliance and the risks of data loss.
3.	Roll Out ERKS and Procedures – Deploy the system to all units. Ensure support channels are in place to address user issues.
4.	Monitor Adoption – Collect feedback, track compliance metrics (e.g., number of records captured, adherence to retention schedule) and adjust training.
Phase 5 – Monitoring and Continuous Improvement (Month 18+)
1.	Perform Regular Audits – The Records Officer conducts annual audits and spot checks. Audit results and remediation actions are reported to the steering committee.
2.	Update Risk Register – Reflect changes in risk exposure. Address emerging threats (e.g., cyber‑security risks) and adapt backup strategies accordingly.
3.	Policy Review and Amendments – Review the policy every three years or when legislation changes. Incorporate lessons learned and technological advances.
4.	Sustain Training and Awareness – Integrate records management into onboarding and professional development programmes.
Budget Proposal
The proposed budget is high‑level and should be refined through procurement processes. Costs are expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD) and assume the ministry already has basic IT infrastructure.
Cost category	Description	Estimated cost range (CAD)	Notes
Project management and staff time	Dedicated Records Officer (0.5 FTE), IT support, project manager over 18 months	$150 000–$220 000	Utilise existing staff where possible; secondment from other departments can lower cost.
Electronic Recordkeeping System (ERKS)	Licensing or development of a compliant ERKS, including metadata, classification and retention functionality	$80 000–$200 000	Open‑source options may reduce fees; government‑hosted solutions could be leveraged.
Hardware and storage	Network‑attached storage units, external backup media, off‑site storage services, scanning equipment	$60 000–$100 000	Reuse existing hardware where possible; negotiate with central IT for shared services.
Cloud backup subscription	Encrypted cloud storage to satisfy the off‑site backup requirement	$20 000–$40 000 (annual)	Costs vary depending on data volume; consider government cloud agreements.
Digitisation services	Outsourcing or in‑house scanning of legacy paper records; includes labour and equipment	$100 000–$250 000	Prioritise essential records to control costs; use phased approach.
Training and change management	Developing training materials, conducting workshops and creating the guidebook	$30 000–$50 000	Use internal expertise and online modules to reduce expenses.
Audit and compliance	External audit support and legal consultation to ensure compliance	$20 000–$40 000	May be lower if internal audit resources are available.
Contingency (10–15 %)	Reserve for unforeseen costs	$40 000–$90 000	Recommended to mitigate risks.
Total estimated budget: $500 000–$950 000 over approximately two fiscal years. This range can be adjusted downward by leveraging shared services, delaying less critical digitisation or adopting open‑source solutions.
Guidebook for Staff and Managers
The guidebook supplements the policy by providing practical instructions and checklists. It should be distributed as a separate document or integrated into the ministry’s intranet.
1. Introduction
The guidebook explains the importance of records management and provides step‑by‑step instructions to comply with the Modernised MSLR Policy Book. It is designed for all staff and is organised by common tasks.
2. Identifying a Record
1.	Ask “Does this document a decision or transaction?” If yes, it is likely a record.
2.	Check the retention schedule to determine the record series and retention period.
3.	Determine sensitivity (public, restricted, confidential) to apply appropriate security controls.
4.	Capture metadata (creator, date, description, keywords) when storing digital files.
3. Creating and Capturing Records
•	Use official templates for letters, memos, reports and registry entries.
•	Save electronic records directly into the ERKS or approved shared drives, not on personal drives. Ensure metadata fields are completed.
•	Label physical records clearly with unique identifiers. File them in the designated location within three days of creation.
•	For emails that constitute records, save them to the ERKS or use the email integration feature to capture them automatically.
4. Classifying and Filing Records
•	Use the approved classification scheme. If unsure, consult the Records Officer.
•	File documents promptly to ensure they are discoverable and protected.
•	Group related documents into folders or electronic containers representing transactions or projects.
5. Applying Retention and Disposal
•	Refer to the retention schedule regularly. The ERKS will flag records approaching their retention period.
•	For physical records, the Records Officer will issue destruction notices. Do not dispose of any records without written authorisation.
•	For digital records, the ERKS will automate disposal after approval. Confirm before final deletion.
6. Backing Up Your Work
•	Ensure that all critical files are stored in locations included in the ministry’s backup plan. Personal devices and external drives are not backed up.
•	Do not alter or disable backup settings. Report backup failures or anomalies to IT immediately.
7. Protecting Confidential Information
•	Follow the classification guidelines: restrict access to confidential records to authorised individuals only.
•	Use strong passwords and do not share credentials.
•	Do not email confidential information to personal accounts or unencrypted recipients.
•	If a breach or exposure occurs, report it immediately to the Records Officer and Information Security Officer.
8. Handling Paper Records
•	Store paper records in secured cabinets or rooms when not in use.
•	Control access using keys or access cards. Do not leave sensitive documents unattended.
•	Protect records from environmental damage by maintaining appropriate humidity and temperature. Use archival‑quality folders and boxes for long‑term storage.
•	When scanning records, follow the scanning standard (minimum 300 dpi, colour where necessary). Verify legibility before disposing of originals.
9. Requesting Records (Access and FOIP)
•	Direct all external requests for records to the designated FOIP officer.
•	Do not release records without proper authorisation and redaction of sensitive information.
•	Maintain a log of requests and disclosures for auditing purposes.
10. Training and Support
•	New employees must complete the records management training module within one month of hire.
•	Refresher training is required every two years or when significant policy changes occur.
•	The intranet hosts guides, FAQs and video tutorials. Contact the Records Officer for assistance.
Conclusion
The ministry’s risk register highlights the critical need for a comprehensive, modern records management policy that integrates data protection and backup practices. The finalised Modernised MSLR Policy Book above, together with the implementation plan, budget proposal and practical guidebook, provides the structure required to reduce the risk of data loss, comply with statutory obligations and support efficient service delivery. By implementing these measures—particularly adopting an electronic recordkeeping system, following a 3‑2‑1 backup strategy[10], and training staff—the ministry can ensure that essential records remain accessible, authentic and secure for the benefit of current and future stakeholders.
