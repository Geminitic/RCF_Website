# Rhizome Community Foundation Website

This repository contains the source code for the Rhizome Community Foundation website. The project is based on the Bolt Vite React TypeScript template.

Static resources for the Knowledge Hub now live in `src/knowledge-hub` and are copied into the final build using `vite-plugin-static-copy`.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Ensure you run this command in an environment with internet access so that packages like `@eslint/js` can be installed.

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Lint the project**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   If linting fails with a `Cannot find package '@eslint/js'` error, make sure the dependencies have been installed correctly.

## Deployment Notes

- This repository now includes a `_headers` file that sets basic security headers processed by Netlify during deployment.
- To deploy on Netlify, create a new site pointing to this repository and enable SSL in the Netlify dashboard. If Netlify refuses to provision SSL, verify that your domain DNS records point to Netlify and that no conflicting certificates exist.
- Netlify serverless functions live in `netlify/functions` and handle contact,
  registration and photo uploads.
- The codebase does not currently integrate with Supabase or Neon. Any references to those services are likely from previous experiments or external configurations not present in this repository.
