# Design Style Variants

This repository includes multiple CSS themes that can be used to style pages.
The following styles are available:

- **Luminous Minimalism** – clean layouts with white space and subtle gradients. Uses `luminous-minimalism.css`.
- **Organic Rhizome** – warm, organic shapes and earthy colors. Uses `organic-rhizome.css`.
- **Neo-Futurist Night** – dark mode with neon accents and glassmorphism. Uses `neo-futurist-night.css`.
- **Desert Mosaic** – geometric patterns and bold color blocking. Uses `desert-mosaic.css`.

Import the desired stylesheet in your page component to apply a theme, e.g.:

```tsx
import '../styles/luminous-minimalism.css';
```
