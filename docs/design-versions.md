# Design Versions

This document outlines four proposed design directions for the Rhizome Community Foundation website. Each version describes a distinctive style, mood, color palette, and key design details.

## 1. Luminous Minimalism
- **Style**: Ultra-clean layouts with generous white space and smooth gradients. Cards feature rounded corners, soft drop shadows, and micro‑interactions.

- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: Pure White (#FFFFFF), Misty Silver (#F5F7FA)
  - Accent: Electric Blue (#338FFF), Mint Green (#57E6B5)
  - Contrast: Charcoal Gray (#222831), Soft Sky (#EDF6FF)
- **Design Details**: Circular icons, modern sans‑serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Poppins), elegant hover motion, and oversized hero imagery with light overlays.

## 2. Organic Rhizome
- **Style**: Wavy lines, root‑like dividers, and hand‑drawn textures referencing rhizomatic networks.
- **Mood**: Warm and human, emphasizing connection and grassroots energy.
- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: Warm Sand (#FFF6E0), Cream (#F9E7C8)

- **Design Details**: Curved sections, organic blobs, brush‑stroke highlights, serif and handwritten font accents, and earthy iconography.

## 3. Neo‑Futurist Night

- **Design Details**: Overlapping tessellations, playful color blocking, custom mosaic‑style icons, and pairings like Noto Serif with Montserrat.

## Rhizomatic Fractal Navigation
- **Concept**: Navigation modeled after fractal branching and rhizomatic structures, creating organic paths instead of simple menus.
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Nodes appear as glowing points in the colors Rooting Brown (#4A3728), Growth Green (#6ECB63), Energy Amber (#FFC947), and Rhizome Blue (#307BAF).
  - Animated branches connect nodes, growing and fading as users explore.
  - Each journey visualizes how content nodes interlink, forming a unique pattern.
